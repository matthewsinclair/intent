# Work In Progress

This file serves as a placeholder for kicking off new sessions.

See the following files for detailed information about the project:

- [Technical Product Design](../eng/tpd/technical_product_design.md)
- [Steel Threads Overview](st/steel_threads.md)

Read CLAUDE.md then wait for instruction.

#### Restart

{{RESTART}}

#### Todo

{{TODO}}

## Important Notes

- Always refer to the tool as "Intent" not "STP"
- The methodology is still "Steel Thread Process" but the tool is "Intent"
- Check CLAUDE.md for project-specific instructions
- This is a fail-forward implementation - no rollback mechanisms

## First Steps

  1. Read the current TPD at `intent/eng/tpd/technical_product_design.md`
  2. Compare it with actual implementation in `bin/` directory
  3. Review test coverage and what's actually working
  4. Create a comprehensive update plan before making changes
