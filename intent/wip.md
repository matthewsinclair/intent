# Work In Progress

This file serves as a placeholder for kicking off new sessions.

See the following files for detailed information about the project:

- [Technical Product Design](../eng/tpd/technical_product_design.md)
- [Steel Threads Overview](st/steel_threads.md)

Read CLAUDE.md then wait for instruction.

#### Restart

⏺ **Intent Agent System - Documentation Complete, Version Alignment Needed**

## Current State Summary

### ✅ Successfully Implemented (ST0017)

Intent v2.1.0 now includes a complete Claude Code sub-agent integration system:

**Core Implementation:**

- 6 fully functional agent commands: `list`, `install`, `sync`, `uninstall`, `show`, `status`
- 50 tests passing (42 agent-specific + 8 new status tests)
- 2 working agents: Intent (steel thread methodology) + Elixir (code doctor)
- Manifest-based tracking with checksum integrity
- Integration with `intent init`, `intent doctor`, `intent upgrade`

**Technical Architecture:**

- Agent storage: `$INTENT_HOME/agents/` (global), `./intent/agents/` (project)
- Installation target: `~/.claude/agents/`
- Manifest tracking: JSON manifests with checksums
- Sync mechanism: File-based with modification detection

### 📝 Documentation Updates Completed

- ✅ ST0017 steel thread marked completed
- ✅ Technical Product Design updated with agent system architecture
- ✅ Usage Rules enhanced with Claude Code agent workflows
- ✅ Blog posts updated + new "Intent Agents" post created
- ✅ Main README updated with agent integration examples

### ✅ Version Alignment Complete

**Status:** All documentation and configuration has been successfully updated to v2.1.0
**Impact:** Agent system is now properly integrated as part of Intent v2.1.0

### 🎯 Completed Tasks

1. **Version Update Complete ✅**
   - ✅ Technical Product Design updated to v2.1.0
   - ✅ Usage Rules updated with v2.1.0 references  
   - ✅ Blog posts updated to reference v2.1.0
   - ✅ README updated with agent init instructions
   - ✅ Example projects updated to v2.1.0
   - ✅ Test suite updated with v2.1.0 expectations
   - ✅ Documentation throughout codebase aligned

2. **Remaining Documentation (Priority: Medium)**
   - Add comprehensive agents section to user guide
   - Release notes created in CHANGELOG.md for v2.1.0
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Create agent development guide

### 🔧 Key Technical Details

- All tests passing: `bats tests/unit/agent_commands.bats` (50/50)
- Agent help available: `intent help agents`
- Example usage: `intent agents install intent`
- Status check: `intent agents status`

### 📂 Important Files

- Implementation: `/Users/matts/Devel/prj/Intent/bin/intent_agents`
- Tests: `/Users/matts/Devel/prj/Intent/tests/unit/agent_commands.bats`
- Help: `/Users/matts/Devel/prj/Intent/lib/help/agents.help.md`
- Agents: `/Users/matts/Devel/prj/Intent/agents/{intent,elixir}/`

### 🚀 Current Status

The agent system is **100% functional** and ready for use. The only remaining work is documentation alignment and completing lower-priority docs.

**Quick Start for New Session:**

1. Run tests to verify: `bats tests/unit/agent_commands.bats`
2. Check status: `intent agents list`
3. Continue with version alignment tasks above

#### Todo

{{TODO}}

## Important Notes

- Always refer to the tool as "Intent" not "STP"
- The methodology is still "Steel Thread Process" but the tool is "Intent"
- Check CLAUDE.md for project-specific instructions
- This is a fail-forward implementation - no rollback mechanisms

## First Steps

  1. Read the current TPD at `intent/eng/tpd/technical_product_design.md`
  2. Compare it with actual implementation in `bin/` directory
  3. Review test coverage and what's actually working
  4. Create a comprehensive update plan before making changes
