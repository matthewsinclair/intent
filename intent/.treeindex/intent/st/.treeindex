I need to read the st/ directory structure first:
<function_calls>
<invoke name="Glob">
<parameter name="pattern">/Users/matts/Devel/prj/Intent/intent/st/*</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

Now I'll generate the .treeindex for st/:

# st/

Container for all steel threads across their lifecycle. Organizes work into focused, self-contained units with design, implementation, and task tracking. Steel threads progress through states: active WIP, completed, or not-yet-started.

## Dirs

- `COMPLETED/` -- 25 finished steel threads (ST0001-ST0025) documenting completed features, refactoring, and infrastructure improvements
- `NOT-STARTED/` -- Identified but unstarted steel threads awaiting resources or priority

## Files

- `steel_threads.md` -- Master index of all steel threads with status, creation, and completion dates
- `ST0024/` -- Active work-in-progress steel thread for work package feature (created 2026-02-24)
