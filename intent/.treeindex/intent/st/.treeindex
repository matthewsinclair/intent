# st/

Container directory for steel threads organized by status and identifier. Steel threads (ST####) are self-contained units of work that implement specific features or improvements to Intent. The directory structure separates active work from completed and not-yet-started steel threads.

## Dirs

- `COMPLETED/` -- Archived steel threads (ST0001 through ST0019) that have finished implementation
- `NOT-STARTED/` -- Planned steel threads awaiting resources or priority
- `ST0020/` -- Modernizing Intent's Elixir support with skills and subagents
- `ST0021/` -- Intent Autopsy: session analysis system for detecting corrections and regressions
- `ST0022/` -- Hardening `intent st new`: special char escaping, slugs, and --start flag

## Files

- `steel_threads.md` -- Master index of all steel threads with status tracking and navigation
