Root directory for all steel threads, organizing self-contained units of work that implement specific features or improvements. Completed threads are archived in COMPLETED/, while active work-in-progress threads live at this level.

## Dirs

- `COMPLETED/` -- Archive of all 22 finished steel threads (ST0001-ST0022) from initial project structure through v2.4.0
- `ST0023/` -- Remove Backlog.md integration and npm-based backlog tool wrapper (v2.4.0 -> v2.5.0)
- `ST0024/` -- Elevate work packages to first-class citizens within steel threads for better organization

## Files

- `steel_threads.md` -- Master index and status definitions for all steel threads across the project
</parameter>

Done. I've generated the `.treeindex` file for the `st/` directory at `intent/.treeindex/intent/st/.treeindex`. It documents the three subdirectories (COMPLETED, ST0023, ST0024) and the master `steel_threads.md` index file.
