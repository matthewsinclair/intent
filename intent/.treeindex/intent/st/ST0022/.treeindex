# ST0022/

Steel thread for hardening the `intent st new` command with three features: escaping special characters in titles via sed, auto-generating slugs (URL-safe identifiers up to 50 chars), and a `-s|--start` flag to create and immediately start a steel thread in one command. All three work packages implemented and tested (327 tests passing).

## Files
