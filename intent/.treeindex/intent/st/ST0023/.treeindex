# ST0023/

Steel thread for removing Backlog.md integration from Intent (v2.4.0 -> v2.5.0). This removes the deprecated npm-based backlog tool wrapper along with CLI commands (`bl`, `task`, `status`, `migrate`), documentation, templates, tests, and CI/CD dependencies affecting ~70+ files across the codebase.

## Files

- `info.md` -- Steel thread metadata, objectives, and work package definitions (WP01-WP08)
- `design.md` -- Design decisions: doc-first methodology, blog editor's notes, TPD annotations, Node.js CI removal, and alternatives considered
- `impl.md` -- Implementation progress tracking across eight work packages
- `tasks.md` -- Task checklist and work package dependencies
