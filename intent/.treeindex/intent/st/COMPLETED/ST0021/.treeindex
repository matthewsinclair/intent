# ST0021/

Completed steel thread for Intent Autopsy, a session analysis system that compares Claude Code behavior against stated rules (MEMORY.md, CLAUDE.md) to identify gaps, enforcement failures, undocumented conventions, and stale memory. ST0021 shipped the `intent-autopsy` skill, an Elixir preprocessing script (`autopsy.exs`), and extended the skills infrastructure for full directory installation.
