# ST0016/

Steel thread documenting the major v2.0.0 refactoring to rename STP to Intent, addressing architectural concerns by separating tool executables from project artifacts. Implements new commands (bootstrap, doctor, init, upgrade) and robust migration logic for upgrading existing STP projects across all versions. Phases 0-2 complete: test infrastructure, new commands, and migration functionality fully implemented.
