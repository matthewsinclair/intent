# autopsy/

Timestamped autopsy reports generated by the `intent-autopsy` skill. Each report analyzes session history and documents findings about memory gaps, enforcement failures, undocumented conventions, and user flags. Multiple runs on the same day use date-suffixed filenames (e.g., 20260220.md, 20260220b.md for verification runs).

## Files

- `20260220.md` -- Initial autopsy analysis with memory gap findings and enforcement failures
- `20260220b.md` -- Post-update verification confirming memory updates and checking for regressions
