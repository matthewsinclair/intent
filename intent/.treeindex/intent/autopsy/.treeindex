# autopsy/

This directory stores historical autopsy reports that analyze project sessions, memory accuracy, rule enforcement, and undocumented conventions. Reports use date-suffixed naming (e.g., `20260220.md`, `20260220b.md`) to track multiple analyses on the same day.

## Files

- `20260220.md` -- Initial analysis of 12 sessions from Feb 17-20; identified 4 corrections, 5 user flag false positives, 84 banned word violations; proposed 6 memory updates
- `20260220b.md` -- Post-update verification confirming all 6 memory updates applied; re-analyzed same sessions with 8 false positive flags and no new enforcement failures
