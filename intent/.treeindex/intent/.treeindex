I'll generate a `.treeindex` for the `intent/` directory. Let me first check what's at the top level:
<function_calls>
[{"tool_name": "Bash", "arguments": {"command": "ls -la /Users/matts/Devel/prj/Intent/intent/ | grep -v '\\.treeindex'"}}]
</function_calls>

Now I'll generate the `.treeindex` for the `intent/` directory:
<function_calls>
[{"tool_name": "Write", "arguments": {"path": "intent/.treeindex/intent/.treeindex", "content": "# intent/\n\nProject artifacts, documentation, and work tracking for Intent. Organizes steel threads, technical specifications, user documentation, and LLM collaboration guidelines.\n\n## Dirs\n\n- `autopsy/` -- Historical analysis reports auditing sessions, memory accuracy, rule enforcement\n- `docs/` -- Public documentation and blog posts on Intent methodology and usage patterns\n- `eng/` -- Engineering work artifacts, design docs, implementation specifications\n- `llm/` -- LLM-specific guidelines and agent/skill configuration for developers\n- `plugins/` -- Plugin architecture for modular subsystems (agents, Claude Code integration)\n- `st/` -- Steel threads organized across lifecycle states (active, completed, not-started)\n- `usr/` -- User-facing documentation (guides, references, deployment instructions)\n\n## Files\n\n- `steel_threads.md` -- Master index of all steel threads with status tracking\n"}}]
</function_calls>

Done! Generated `.treeindex` for `intent/` at `intent/.treeindex/intent/.treeindex`. It provides a high-level overview of the seven main subdirectories (autopsy, docs, eng, llm, plugins, st, usr) and the steel_threads.md index file that ties them together.
