I'll generate the `.treeindex` file for the `intent/` directory using the existing child directory summaries and understanding of the structure.

Done. I've generated the `.treeindex` for the `intent/` directory. It documents the 8 subdirectories (in alphabetical order) and 3 key files, providing a high-level overview of Intent's artifact organization.
