I'll first check what's actually in the `prps/` directory, then generate the `.treeindex` file.

<function_calls>
[{"tool_name": "Glob", "arguments": {"pattern": "prps/**/*", "maxDepth": 3}}]
</function_calls>

```
prps/
prps/Wirasm--PRPs-agentic-eng- Prompts, workflows and more for agentic engineering.webloc
```

The `prps/` directory contains only a single `.webloc` file (a macOS bookmark/URL reference). Here's the `.treeindex`:

# prps/

Collection of bookmarks and references to external agentic engineering resources and prompts. Contains links to related repositories and documentation on prompt engineering patterns (PRPs).

## Files

- `Wirasm--PRPs-agentic-eng- Prompts, workflows and more for agentic engineering.webloc` -- Bookmark to the Wirasm PRPs GitHub repository with agentic engineering patterns and workflows
