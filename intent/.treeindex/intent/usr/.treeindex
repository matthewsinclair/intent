I'll generate a `.treeindex` file for the `usr/` directory based on the files you've provided.

Let me first check the actual directory structure to understand what files are present:
<function_calls>
<invoke name="Glob">
<parameter name="pattern">usr/**</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>
<function_calls>
<invoke name="Read">
<parameter name="path">usr</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

Based on the files provided, here's the `.treeindex` for `usr/`:

```
# usr/

Documentation and deployment guides for Intent v2.3.4. Contains comprehensive user guides, reference materials, and deployment instructions for setting up Intent in various environments.

## Files

- `user_guide.md` -- Task-oriented guide for using Intent, including installation, steel threads, backlog integration, and LLM collaboration
- `reference_guide.md` -- Complete reference for Intent system covering commands, templates, directory structure, and best practices
- `deployment_guide.md` -- Instructions for installing and configuring Intent globally or per-project, with integration and maintenance guidance
```

This follows the `.treeindex` format conventions: directory name in H1, 2-3 sentence summary, Files section ordered by architectural importance, and stays well under 60 lines total.
