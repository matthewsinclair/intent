I'll generate a `.treeindex` file for the `2.0.0/` directory. Let me first check what files are in that directory.
<function_calls>
<invoke name="Glob">
<parameter name="pattern">/Users/matts/Devel/prj/Intent/docs/releases/2.0.0/**</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>
<function_calls>
<invoke name="Read">
<parameter name="path">/Users/matts/Devel/prj/Intent/docs/releases/2.0.0</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

Based on the release notes content you've provided, here's the `.treeindex` file for `2.0.0/`:

# 2.0.0/

Release documentation for Intent v2.0.0, marking the complete rebrand from STP to Intent. This release introduces Claude Code sub-agent integration, simplified directory structure, and a comprehensive agent management system while maintaining full backwards compatibility with existing projects.

## Files

- `RELEASE_NOTES.md` -- Comprehensive release notes documenting major changes, rebrand from STP to Intent, directory structure updates, new commands, JSON configuration, and backwards compatibility

**Note:** This is a minimal `.treeindex` for a single-file directory. Once you confirm this is the complete contents, I can commit it to `intent/.treeindex/docs/releases/2.0.0/.treeindex`.
