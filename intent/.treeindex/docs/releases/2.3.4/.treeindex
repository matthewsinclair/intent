I need to check what's in the `2.3.4/` directory first.

The `2.3.4/` directory doesn't exist in the working directory. Based on the git status and MEMORY.md, the project is at v2.4.0. The `RELEASE_NOTES.md` you provided appears to be documentation content rather than an actual directory to index.

Could you clarify what you'd like me to index? Would you like me to:

1. Generate a `.treeindex` for an existing directory (e.g., `intent/plugins/`, `bin/`, `tests/unit/`)?
2. Create a directory structure under `intent/docs/releases/2.3.4/` with release notes organized there?

Or if you meant to generate a treeindex for `2.3.4/` as part of organizing release documentation, I can help set that up.
