I'll generate a .treeindex file for the 2.2.0 directory. Let me first explore its structure.
<function_calls>
<invoke name="Glob">
<parameter name="pattern">2.2.0/**/*</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>
<function_calls>
<invoke name="Read">
<parameter name="path">2.2.0</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

Let me check what files are in this directory:
<function_calls>
<invoke name="Bash">
<parameter name="command">find 2.2.0 -type f | head -20</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

Let me try a different approach:
<function_calls>
<invoke name="Bash">
<parameter name="command">ls -la 2.2.0/</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

It looks like the 2.2.0 directory only contains the RELEASE_NOTES.md file that was provided in your message. Based on the context, this appears to be release documentation rather than a source code directory structure.

However, if you're asking me to generate a .treeindex file for this directory as it would exist in the Intent project structure, here's what that would look like:

# 2.2.0/

Release documentation and migration notes for Intent v2.2.0, introducing the fileindex command for file tracking and progress management through large codebases.

## Files

- `RELEASE_NOTES.md` -- Release notes covering new fileindex command, enhanced Elixir agent, upgrade improvements, and migration notes from v2.1.0

---

Could you clarify if you'd like me to:
1. Save this as a formal `.treeindex` file in the shadow directory?
2. Review actual source code files in a 2.2.0 release directory?
3. Generate documentation for a different directory structure?
