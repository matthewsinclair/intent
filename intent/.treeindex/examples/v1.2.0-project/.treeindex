A minimal Intent v1.2.0 project demonstrating the foundational structure for organizing steel threads and project artifacts. This is a reference template showing the essential directories and files required for Intent-based project management.

## Dirs

- `intent/` -- Project artifacts including steel threads, documentation, and configuration
- `backlog/` -- Task management and tracking (optional directory for Backlog.md workflows)

## Files

- `.gitignore` -- Git ignore rules for Intent-specific files, backups, and editor configurations
- `CLAUDE.md` -- Project guidelines and Intent command reference (if present)
- `README.md` -- Project overview and getting started guide (if present)
