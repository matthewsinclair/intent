# st/

Steel threads directory organizing self-contained work units for the Intent project. Each steel thread (ST####/) contains lifecycle documentation files (info.md, design.md, impl.md, tasks.md) that track metadata, design decisions, implementation details, and task status. Active threads remain in the main directory; completed work and queued threads are organized in status folders.
