# ST0016: Results

## Summary

**Phase 0 Completed**: Test infrastructure has been created with all example projects and comprehensive test suites ready for implementation phases.

**Phase 1 Completed**: New Intent v2.0.0 commands (bootstrap, doctor) implemented in top-level bin/ directory with jq-based JSON configuration system.

**Phase 2 Completed**: Migration commands (init, upgrade) implemented with full support for all STP versions and comprehensive testing on example projects.

## Issues Encountered

### During Development

1. None so far - Phase 0 completed successfully

### During Testing

1. *List any test failures or edge cases*

### Post-Release

1. *Track any user-reported issues*

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- Test-first approach provides clear validation criteria
- Example projects help visualize migration requirements
- BATS test framework works well for CLI testing

### What Could Be Improved

- *To be documented*

### Future Considerations

- *Ideas for v2.1.0 or beyond*

## User Feedback

*Collect and document user feedback post-release*

## Conclusion

*Final assessment of the refactoring success*
