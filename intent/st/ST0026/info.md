# ST0026: Steel Thread Zero

## Objective

Define and implement a "Steel Thread Zero" (ST0000) concept: a foundational steel thread that every new Intent-managed project runs FIRST, before any feature work begins. ST0000 primes the project with every countermeasure we know to prevent code quality violations from accumulating.

The goal: make it structurally impossible (or at least very hard) for the violations found in audits like ST0058 (408 violations in laksa-web) to ever happen again.

## Context

### The Problem

Across two independent projects, total codebase audits found a combined **797 violations**:

**laksa-web (ST0058)**: 408 violations in ~258 files

- 7 P0 bugs/crash risks (bare `=` on fallible calls, `String.to_atom` on user input, etc.)
- 14 P1 Highlander duplications (same logic in 2-12 places)
- ~50 P2 thick coordinators (business logic in controllers/LiveViews/CLI commands)
- ~337 P3 mechanical style violations (boolean operators, missing @impl, etc.)

**Lamplight (ST0098)**: 389 violations in ~724 files (5-app umbrella)

- P0 bugs: `String.to_atom` on LLM output, dependency graph violations, non-exhaustive `with`
- 88 P1 Highlander duplications (23% of all violations — dominant issue)
- 35 P2 thick coordinators (REPL commands, LiveViews with 50+ line handlers)
- ~200 P3 mechanical style violations

These accumulated over months of development. Each violation was individually small, but collectively they represented significant technical debt. The remediation took substantial effort (~5 hours per project).

### The Root Cause

The violations weren't caused by ignorance — the rules existed in `RULES.md`. They accumulated because:

1. **Rules weren't present from commit one** — they were added after patterns were already established
2. **No canonical module registry** — developers (human and AI) didn't know which module already owned a concern, so they created duplicates
3. **No archetype templates** — new controllers/LiveViews started blank, so business logic crept in
4. **No automated enforcement** — mechanical violations (boolean operators, @impl) had no tooling to catch them
5. **No "where does this go?" guidance** — the decision of where to put logic was left to ad-hoc judgement
6. **Session amnesia** — Claude Code lost learned patterns on every context reset, re-learning the same mistakes
7. **No periodic health checks** — violations accumulated silently until the audit
8. **No dependency graph enforcement** — umbrella apps allowed cross-app imports that violated the intended architecture (Lamplight-specific)
9. **No trust-boundary awareness** — blanket safety rules (e.g., `String.to_existing_atom` everywhere) were applied without distinguishing controlled inputs from untrusted inputs (Lamplight-specific)

### The Solution: Prevention Over Remediation

ST0000 addresses each root cause with a specific countermeasure, delivered as Intent infrastructure that applies to every new project.

### Retrofit Requirement

ST0000 must work in TWO modes:

1. **Bootstrap mode**: `intent init --with-st0000` on a new project (greenfield)
2. **Retrofit mode**: `intent st zero install` on an existing project (brownfield)

Both laksa-web and Lamplight need retrofit installation. The retrofit process must:

- Audit the existing codebase to populate `MODULES.md` from actual module usage (not from scratch)
- Detect existing patterns (controller styles, service module conventions) and encode them rather than imposing new ones
- Generate a gap analysis: "these countermeasures are already present, these are missing"
- Be incremental — install one deliverable at a time, don't require big-bang adoption
- Not break existing CLAUDE.md content — merge new rules alongside existing project-specific instructions

## Related Steel Threads

- **laksa-web ST0060**: P2 Thick Coordinator Extractions
- **Lamplight ST0098**: Total Codebase Audit — 389 violations in a 5-app umbrella
- **TN004**: Total Codebase Audit process tech note

## Deliverables

### D1: `intent init --with-st0000` (or `intent st zero`)

A new Intent command that bootstraps a project with all ST0000 countermeasures. This is the primary entry point. Running it on a new (or existing) project should:

1. Create/update `CLAUDE.md` with the full rule set and architectural guidance
2. Create `intent/llm/RULES.md` from a language-appropriate template
3. Create `intent/llm/MODULES.md` (canonical module registry)
4. Create `intent/llm/DECISION_TREE.md` (where does this go?)
5. Create `intent/llm/ARCHETYPES.md` (module templates)
6. Prime Claude Code memory with operational knowledge
7. Optionally scaffold custom Credo checks (Elixir projects)

### D2: CLAUDE.md Template with Rules Baked In

A comprehensive CLAUDE.md template that includes:

- The complete rule set (not just a reference to RULES.md)
- The canonical module registry (inline or by reference)
- The "where does this go?" decision tree
- Session start checklist (what to read on every context reset)
- Project-specific patterns and conventions

**Key principle**: CLAUDE.md is read on EVERY conversation. If the rules are there from commit one, every line of code is written against them.

### D3: Canonical Module Registry (`MODULES.md`)

A living document that declares ownership of concerns:

```markdown
## Auth & Authorization

| Concern            | THE Module                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Auth checks        | `MyApp.Authorization`       |
| Session management | `MyApp.Auth.SessionService` |

## Content

| Concern         | THE Module                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Content hashing | `MyApp.Content.ContentHasher` |
| Status parsing  | `MyApp.Content.StatusParser`  |
```

**Enforcement mechanism**: An Intent command or skill that:

- Validates new modules are registered before creation
- Warns when a module is created that overlaps an existing registry entry
- Can be queried: `intent modules find "subscription status"` → shows the canonical module

### D4: Archetype Templates

Starter templates for common module types that are ALREADY correct:

| Archetype          | What it enforces                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ash Domain         | Domain module with `resources` block, code interfaces   |
| Ash Resource       | Resource with actions, policies, attributes skeleton    |
| Phoenix Controller | Thin coordinator: parse params → call service → render  |
| LiveView           | Two-phase mount, handle_event → service → assign        |
| Service Module     | Pure business logic, tagged tuple returns, @spec        |
| CLI Command        | Arca.Cli BaseCommand, config macro, delegate to service |
| GenServer/Worker   | Callbacks with @impl, init/handle\_\* skeleton          |
| Oban Worker        | @impl perform/1, tagged tuple returns                   |
| Test Module        | ExUnit skeleton with describe blocks, setup             |

Each template includes:

- Comments explaining what goes here vs what goes elsewhere
- Anti-patterns as comments: `# DO NOT put business logic here`
- Links to the canonical module for the concern

**Delivery**: `intent generate <archetype> <module_name>` or integrated into existing `mix` generators.

### D5: Automated Rule Enforcement

#### D5a: Custom Credo Checks (Elixir)

Programmatic enforcement of mechanical rules that can be checked statically:

| Check                   | Rule | What it catches                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------- | --- | ------------------------------ |
| `BooleanOperators`      | R8   | `&&`/`                                             |     | ` on known boolean expressions |
| `MissingImplAnnotation` | R11  | Behaviour callbacks without `@impl true`           |
| `DebugArtifacts`        | R15  | `IO.inspect`, `IO.puts`, `dbg()` in lib/           |
| `MapGetOnStruct`        | R7   | `Map.get(known_struct, :field)`                    |
| `ThickCoordinator`      | R2   | Controllers/LiveViews exceeding line threshold     |
| `HighlanderSuspect`     | R6   | Functions with identical names in multiple modules |

These would live in the project's `lib/mix/checks/` or as a shared Credo plugin.

**Important**: Not all rules are statically enforceable. R6 (Highlander) in particular requires semantic understanding. The `HighlanderSuspect` check flags _potential_ duplicates by name; actual Highlander enforcement needs periodic audits (D7).

#### D5b: `intent audit quick` Command

A lightweight audit command that runs the enforceable checks without a full Socratic sub-agent audit:

```bash
intent audit quick              # Run all automated checks
intent audit quick --rule R8    # Run specific rule check
intent audit quick --fix        # Auto-fix where possible
```

For Elixir: wraps `mix credo` with custom checks.
For other languages: wraps the ecosystem's linter with custom rules.

### D6: Decision Tree ("Where Does This Go?")

A flowchart document that answers the single most common question:

```
Is it a database query or data transformation?
  → Ash resource action or domain module

Is it business logic (validation, orchestration, calculation)?
  → Dedicated service module in lib/myapp/domain/

Is it HTTP request/response handling?
  → Controller (thin: parse params → service → render)

Is it WebSocket/LiveView state management?
  → LiveView (thin: handle_event → service → assign)

Is it a CLI command?
  → Command module (thin: parse args → service → format output)

Is it formatting for display?
  → View helper or component

Does something similar ALREADY EXIST?
  → STOP. Check MODULES.md. Use the existing module.
  → If it doesn't exist yet, register it in MODULES.md FIRST, then create it.
```

### D7: Lightweight Periodic Audit

A command that runs a quick health check, suitable for end-of-day use:

```bash
intent audit health             # ~2 min, covers mechanical rules
intent audit health --report    # Generates a markdown report
intent audit health --diff      # Only check files changed since last audit
```

This is NOT a full Socratic audit (that's TN004). This is:

1. Run custom Credo checks (D5a)
2. Check for new modules not in MODULES.md
3. Flag any controller/LiveView that grew past the line threshold
4. Report any functions with identical names in multiple modules (Highlander suspects)

Output: a short markdown report that can be reviewed in 5 minutes next morning.

### D8: Memory Injection (`intent claude prime`)

**This is the killer feature.**

A command that pre-loads Claude Code's project memory with everything it needs to know:

```bash
intent claude prime                    # Prime current project
intent claude prime --refresh          # Re-prime after rule changes
intent claude prime --from <project>   # Import learnings from another project
```

What it generates/updates in `.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md`:

1. **Operational knowledge**: How to use Intent commands (`intent st`, `intent wp`, `intent treeindex`, etc.) — the stuff that currently takes 35 corrections per session
2. **Project rules**: Condensed from `intent/llm/RULES.md` — the key rules with examples
3. **Canonical modules**: From `MODULES.md` — so the LLM knows what exists before creating duplicates
4. **Known footguns**: Project-specific anti-patterns learned from previous audits
5. **Decision tree**: Condensed "where does this go?" guidance
6. **Session checklist**: What to read on startup and after context resets

**Memory injection sources** (in priority order):

1. `intent/llm/RULES.md` — project coding rules
2. `intent/llm/MODULES.md` — canonical module registry
3. `intent/llm/DECISION_TREE.md` — architectural guidance
4. `intent/llm/ARCHETYPES.md` — module templates reference
5. `.intent/learnings.md` — accumulated project-specific learnings (new file)
6. Global Intent operational knowledge (bundled with Intent itself)

**Post-context-refresh**: The memory file persists across conversations, so it's automatically available after context resets. But we should also add a reminder in CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## After Context Reset

Re-read these files before continuing work:

- intent/llm/RULES.md
- intent/llm/MODULES.md
- This file (CLAUDE.md)
```

### D9: New Module Checklist (enforced via skill or hook)

Before creating ANY new module, the workflow should be:

1. Check `MODULES.md` — does a module for this concern already exist?
2. If yes → extend it (or delegate to it)
3. If no → register the new module in `MODULES.md` FIRST
4. Choose the correct archetype template
5. Place it in the correct directory per the decision tree

**Enforcement options**:

- A Claude Code hook that fires on `Write` tool calls to `lib/**/*.ex` and checks if the module is registered
- An Intent skill that wraps module creation: `intent generate service MyApp.Foo.BarService`
- A CLAUDE.md instruction that says "ALWAYS check MODULES.md before creating a new module"

### D10: Learnings Accumulator

A project-local file (`.intent/learnings.md`) that accumulates hard-won knowledge:

```markdown
## Footguns

- `published_at` has a time component; use date granularity for visibility checks
- Bare `{:ok, x} =` on Ash calls will crash on NotFound — always use case/with

## Patterns That Worked

- Service extraction: controller → service → controller delegates
- Single dispatch point: ServingMode.resolve/1 for all content loading

## Patterns That Failed

- Putting parse_status/1 in each module "because it's small" → 4 incompatible copies
```

Updated manually or via `intent learn "description"` command. Consumed by `intent claude prime` (D8).

## Architecture

### What prevents each violation category

| Category              | Prevention Mechanism                                       | When it fires           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| P0 bugs               | RULES.md in CLAUDE.md + memory                             | Every conversation      |
| P1 Highlander         | MODULES.md registry + `intent modules check`               | Module creation + audit |
| P2 thick coordinators | Archetype templates + decision tree + line threshold check | Module creation + audit |
| P3 mechanical         | Custom Credo checks                                        | Every compile / CI      |

## Non-Goals

- This is NOT a full audit framework (that's TN004)
- This is NOT a CI/CD integration (that's a follow-on)
- This does NOT replace human judgement — it augments it with guardrails

### D11: Umbrella Dependency Graph Enforcement

For umbrella/monorepo projects, enforce the intended dependency graph:

```markdown
## Dependency Graph

| App        | May depend on       | Must NOT depend on        |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| llclient   | (nothing)           | lamplight, frontdesk, ... |
| lamplight  | (nothing)           | llclient, frontdesk, ...  |
| frontdesk  | lamplight, llclient | storyfield, aigency       |
| storyfield | lamplight, llclient | frontdesk, aigency        |
| aigency    | (nothing)           | lamplight, llclient, ...  |
```

**Enforcement**: A check (Credo or `intent audit quick`) that scans `alias`/`import`/`use` statements and flags references to modules in apps that aren't in the dependency list. This catches violations like `lamplight` importing from `llclient` — which compile fine in dev (all apps loaded) but represent an architectural boundary violation.

**Lesson from Lamplight**: `output.ex` (in lamplight) imported `Lamplight.Core.Client.Helpers` (in llclient). This compiled fine but violated the dependency graph. It was only caught by the human-level audit, not by any tooling.

### D12: Retrofit Installation (`intent st zero install`)

Install ST0000 countermeasures into an **existing** project that wasn't bootstrapped with them. This is the brownfield counterpart to D1's greenfield `intent init --with-st0000`.

The retrofit process:

1. **Audit existing state**: Scan the codebase to understand current patterns
   - Discover existing modules and their responsibilities → populate `MODULES.md`
   - Detect existing architectural patterns (controller styles, service conventions)
   - Identify existing rules in CLAUDE.md that should be preserved
2. **Gap analysis**: Compare what ST0000 provides vs what already exists
   - "RULES.md exists but is missing R11, R14, R15"
   - "MODULES.md doesn't exist — generating from codebase scan"
   - "CLAUDE.md exists — merging new sections alongside existing content"
3. **Incremental installation**: Install one deliverable at a time
   - Each deliverable is independent — install D3 without D4 if desired
   - Never overwrite existing content — merge or append
   - Generate a diff for review before applying
4. **Verification**: Run `intent audit quick` to validate the installation

**Key constraint**: Retrofit must be non-destructive. An existing project with 6 months of CLAUDE.md customization must not have that wiped out. The command should generate proposed changes for human review, not apply them blindly.

## Success Criteria

1. A new Intent project bootstrapped with `intent init --with-st0000` should have all countermeasures in place before the first feature commit
2. Running `intent audit quick` on a freshly bootstrapped project should produce zero violations
3. A Claude Code session on a primed project should never need to be told "check MODULES.md first" — it already knows
4. After 3 months of development, running a full TN004 audit should find <50 violations (vs 408 in laksa-web, 389 in Lamplight)
5. `intent st zero install` on an existing project should produce a gap analysis and incremental installation plan without breaking existing configuration
