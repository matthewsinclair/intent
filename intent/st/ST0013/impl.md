# Implementation - ST0013: STP Blog Post Series

## Implementation Plan

1. Draft each blog post in the series
2. Create diagrams and visuals to illustrate key concepts
3. Include code examples and practical demonstrations
4. Ensure consistent terminology and messaging across all posts
5. Optimize content for readability and accessibility

All blog posts will be stored in the `/stp/doc/blog` directory and will be formatted in Markdown.

## Success Criteria

- Complete series of 7 high-quality blog posts
- Clear explanation of STP concepts, especially intent capture
- Practical examples that demonstrate the value of STP
- Logical progression of topics across the series
- Content that is accessible to developers of various experience levels

## Notes

- Each post should be approximately 1000-1500 words
- Include diagrams where appropriate to illustrate concepts (text-based ASCII diagrams are preferred)
- The posts should balance theory and practical application
- Focus on the unique aspects of STP, particularly intent capture and LLM collaboration
- Document the process of writing these blog posts using STP/Backlog itself (meta-documentation)
