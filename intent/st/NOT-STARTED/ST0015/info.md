# ST0015: Enhanced Steel Thread Templates and File Types

- **Status**: Not Started
- **Created**: 2025-07-09
- **Completed**: 
- **Author**: Matthew Sinclair

## Objective

Enhance the steel thread directory structure with additional specialized file types and improved templates to support more comprehensive documentation and workflow patterns.

## Context

With the successful implementation of the directory structure for steel threads (ST0014), we now have a foundation for further enhancements. This steel thread explores adding specialized file types and improving templates based on initial usage experience.

Potential enhancements include:
- Adding `testing.md` for test plans and results
- Adding `metrics.md` for performance and success metrics
- Adding `dependencies.md` for external dependencies
- Enhanced templates with better prompts and examples
- Integration patterns with external tools
