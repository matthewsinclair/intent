# Design - ST0015: Enhanced Steel Thread Templates and File Types

## Approach

1. **Analysis Phase**: Review current usage patterns and identify gaps
2. **Design Phase**: Define new file types and their purposes
3. **Implementation Phase**: Create templates and update scripts
4. **Testing Phase**: Validate with real-world usage

## Design Decisions

### Additional File Types

1. **testing.md**
   - Purpose: Document test plans, test cases, and results
   - Location: Alongside other files in ST####/ directory
   - Template: Include test strategy, cases, and results sections

2. **metrics.md**
   - Purpose: Track success metrics, performance data
   - Location: Alongside other files in ST####/ directory
   - Template: Define metrics, targets, and actuals

3. **dependencies.md**
   - Purpose: Document external dependencies and integrations
   - Location: Alongside other files in ST####/ directory
   - Template: List dependencies with versions and purposes

### Template Enhancements

- Add more helpful prompts in each template
- Include examples where appropriate
- Add section for common patterns
- Better guidance for LLM collaboration

### Optional vs Required Files

- `info.md` remains the only required file
- All other files created on-demand
- `stp st edit ST#### <file>` creates file if missing

## Architecture

No architectural changes required - extends existing directory structure pattern.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Single comprehensive template**: Rejected - goes against separation of concerns
2. **Mandatory all files**: Rejected - too heavy for simple steel threads
3. **Nested subdirectories**: Rejected - adds unnecessary complexity
