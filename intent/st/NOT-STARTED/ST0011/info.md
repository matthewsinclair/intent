# ST0011: Test Suite Implementation

- **Status**: Completed
- **Created**: 2025-06-03
- **Completed**: 2025-06-03
- **Author**: Matthew Sinclair

## Objective

Build a comprehensive test suite for the STP project to verify that bootstrap, initialization, and other core functions work as expected across different environments and scenarios.

## Context

As the STP project grows, it becomes increasingly important to have automated tests to validate that the system works correctly. This steel thread focuses on creating a test framework that can verify the functionality of critical STP components like bootstrap and init scripts, ensuring they behave correctly across different environments and edge cases.

A robust test suite will help maintain the reliability of STP as new features are added and existing ones are modified, reducing the risk of regressions and making it easier to identify and fix issues early.

## Context for LLM

This steel thread focuses on creating a comprehensive test suite for the STP project. Testing shell scripts presents unique challenges, and this work will establish patterns for effective testing of STP components.

### How to update this document

1. Update the status as work progresses
2. Check off tasks as they are completed
3. Add implementation notes as decisions are made or challenges encountered
4. Add results when the steel thread is completed
5. Mark the completion date when finished

The LLM should assist with implementation details and help maintain this document as work progresses.
