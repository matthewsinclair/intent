# Design - ST0011: Test Suite Implementation

## Approach

1. Design a test framework that can run in isolated environments
2. Implement tests for core functionality, starting with bootstrap and init
3. Create test fixtures and mock environments as needed
4. Implement test reporting and result analysis
5. Document the test suite and how to run it
6. Integrate with existing workflows
