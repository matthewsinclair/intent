The command interfaces were refined with:

1. **Consistent Parameter Handling**: Standardized parameter parsing across all commands
2. **Better Error Messages**: More descriptive error messages with suggested solutions
3. **Intelligent Defaults**: Added smart defaults to reduce required input
4. **Cross-platform Support**: Improved compatibility across different operating systems

### Documentation Enhancements

Documentation was enhanced with:

1. **More Examples**: Added additional examples for common tasks
2. **Workflow Guidance**: Included guidance on typical workflows
3. **Updated Screenshots**: Added visual aids for key operations
4. **Troubleshooting Section**: Created a dedicated troubleshooting guide

### LLM Optimizations

LLM integration was optimized with:

1. **Refined Prompts**: Improved standard prompts based on usage patterns
2. **Context Optimization**: Streamlined context information for better generation
3. **Workflow-specific Guidance**: Added LLM guidance tailored to specific workflows
4. **Feedback Incorporation**: Adjusted LLM systems based on user feedback
