- **Status**: Completed
- **Created**: 2025-03-06
- **Completed**: 2025-06-03
- **Author**: Matthew Sinclair

## Objective

Integrate Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities into the STP system to assist with document generation, code creation, and project management tasks.

## Context

LLMs offer powerful capabilities for automating and enhancing many aspects of software development and documentation. This steel thread implements LLM integration into STP, allowing users to leverage AI assistance for various tasks while maintaining human oversight and quality control.

- ST0004: Steel Thread Commands
- ST0007: User Documentation
- ST0009: Process Refinement

## Context for LLM

This document represents a single steel thread - a self-contained unit of work focused on implementing a specific piece of functionality. When working with an LLM on this steel thread, start by sharing this document to provide context about what needs to be done.

### How to update this document

1. Update the status as work progresses
2. Check off tasks as they are completed
3. Add implementation notes as decisions are made or challenges encountered
4. Add results when the steel thread is completed
5. Mark the completion date when finished

The LLM should assist with implementation details and help maintain this document as work progresses.
