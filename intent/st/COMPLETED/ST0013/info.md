# ST0013: STP Blog Post Series

- **Status**: In Progress
- **Created**: 2025-03-11
- **Completed**: 
- **Author**: Matthew Sinclair

## Summary

Create a series of blog posts about the Steel Thread Process (STP) to explain its purpose, philosophy, and implementation. The blog posts will highlight how STP improves software development, particularly when working with LLMs, and discuss the importance of capturing intent in the development process.

## Objectives

1. Explain the STP concept and its benefits to a wider audience
2. Demonstrate how STP enhances collaboration between developers and LLMs
3. Discuss the importance of capturing intent in software development
4. Provide practical examples of STP in action
5. Create a comprehensive yet concise overview of the STP methodology
