# Implementation - ST0007: User Documentation

## Implementation Notes

### Documentation Structure

The user documentation is divided into three main documents:

1. **User Guide**: Focuses on getting started and common tasks
   - Introduction to STP
   - Installation and setup
   - Basic workflows
   - Best practices
   - Getting help

2. **Reference Guide**: Provides detailed information on all commands
   - Complete command reference
   - Configuration options
   - File formats
   - Template customization
   - Advanced usage

3. **Deployment Guide**: For system administrators and team leads
   - System requirements
   - Installation options
   - Team configuration
   - Integration with other tools
   - Maintenance tasks

### Documentation Design Principles

The documentation follows these principles:

1. **Task-oriented**: Organized around user tasks rather than system features
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Basic information first, with links to more advanced topics
3. **Consistent structure**: Each section follows a consistent format
4. **Examples-rich**: Every feature includes practical examples
5. **Visual aids**: Diagrams and screenshots where helpful

### Cross-References

The documentation maintains consistent cross-references:

- Between documents (e.g., from user guide to reference guide)
- To specific command help documentation
- To steel thread documents for technical details
- To external resources where appropriate
