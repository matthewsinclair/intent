- **Status**: Completed
- **Created**: 2025-03-06
- **Completed**: 2025-06-03
- **Author**: Matthew Sinclair

## Objective

Create a template system for STP that provides standardized starting points for all document types and ensures consistency across the project.

## Context

Templates are essential for maintaining consistency in documentation and providing users with immediate guidance on what information to include. This steel thread implements the template system for STP, creating templates for project documents, engineering documents, user documents, and steel threads themselves.

## Related Steel Threads

- ST0001: Directory Structure
- ST0002: Core Script Framework
- ST0005: Initialization Command

## Context for LLM

This document represents a single steel thread - a self-contained unit of work focused on implementing a specific piece of functionality. When working with an LLM on this steel thread, start by sharing this document to provide context about what needs to be done.

### How to update this document

1. Update the status as work progresses
2. Check off tasks as they are completed
3. Add implementation notes as decisions are made or challenges encountered
4. Add results when the steel thread is completed
5. Mark the completion date when finished

The LLM should assist with implementation details and help maintain this document as work progresses.
