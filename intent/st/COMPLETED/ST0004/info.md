# ST0004: Steel Thread Commands

- **Status**: Completed
- **Created**: 2025-03-06
- **Completed**: 2025-06-03
- **Author**: Matthew Sinclair

## Objective

Implement the steel thread command subsystem (`stp st`) to enable users to create, manage, and track steel threads throughout a project lifecycle.

## Context

Steel threads are a core concept in the STP system, representing discrete units of work that can be tracked and documented. This steel thread implements the command-line interface for managing steel threads, including creating new threads, listing existing threads, marking threads as complete, and viewing thread details.

- ST0003: Template System
- ST0006: Help System

## Context for LLM

This document represents a single steel thread - a self-contained unit of work focused on implementing a specific piece of functionality. When working with an LLM on this steel thread, start by sharing this document to provide context about what needs to be done.

### How to update this document

1. Update the status as work progresses
2. Check off tasks as they are completed
3. Add implementation notes as decisions are made or challenges encountered
4. Add results when the steel thread is completed
5. Mark the completion date when finished

The LLM should assist with implementation details and help maintain this document as work progresses.
