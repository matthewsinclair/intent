# Implementation - ST0005: Initialization Command

## Implementation Notes

### Directory Structure Creation

The initialization command creates the following directory structure:

```
project/
├── prj/            # Project documentation
│   ├── st/         # Steel threads
│   │   └── steel_threads.md
│   ├── wip.md      # Work in progress
│   └── journal.md  # Project journal
├── eng/            # Engineering docs
│   └── tpd/        # Technical Product Design
│       ├── technical_product_design.md
│       ├── 1_introduction.md
│       └── ...
├── usr/            # User documentation
│   ├── user_guide.md
│   ├── reference_guide.md
│   └── deployment_guide.md
└── llm/            # LLM-specific content
    └── llm_preamble.md
```

### Template Instantiation

During initialization, the system:
1. Creates all required directories
2. Copies template files from the template directory to their respective locations
3. Removes the leading underscore from template filenames
4. Populates project-specific metadata in templates (project name, date, author, etc.)

### Configuration Management

The initialization process creates a `.stp-config` file that contains:
- Project name
- Project creation date
- Author information
- Project-specific settings
- Paths to important directories and files

This configuration file is used by other STP commands to locate resources and customize behavior.

### User Interaction

The initialization command:
- Prompts for project name if not provided as an argument
- Automatically detects the current user as the author (can be overridden)
- Provides clear feedback during initialization
- Warns if attempting to initialize an existing project
- Displays a success message with next steps after completion
