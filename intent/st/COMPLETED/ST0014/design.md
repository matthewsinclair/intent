# Design - ST0014: Directory Structure for Steel Threads

## Approach
1. Create subdirectories based on status (COMPLETED, NOT-STARTED, CANCELLED)
2. Modify the ST commands to handle the new directory structure
3. Update the upgrade script to organize files during upgrades
4. Update documentation to reflect the new structure
