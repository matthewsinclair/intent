# Results - ST0002: Core Script Framework

## Results

The core script framework was successfully implemented with all planned components:

- Created a modular command dispatching system
- Implemented environment variable handling and configuration
- Created a robust error handling framework
- Built a help system for documentation access
- Implemented core commands (init, st, help)
- Tested functionality across different environments
- Added verbose mode for debugging and troubleshooting

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the STP command-line interface, with a modular design that makes it easy to add new commands and extend functionality. The error handling is robust, providing clear messages to users when issues occur. The command dispatching system efficiently routes commands to their specific implementation scripts, maintaining a clean separation of concerns.
