# ST0016: Phase 1 Completion Summary

## Overview

Phase 1 (New Commands Implementation) has been completed successfully. All new Intent v2.0.0 commands are working in the top-level `/bin/` directory.

## Completed Items

### 1. Directory Structure
- Created `/Users/matts/Devel/prj/STP/bin/` (top-level executables)
- Created `/Users/matts/Devel/prj/STP/lib/` (for future templates)

### 2. Core Library: intent_config
**Location**: `/Users/matts/Devel/prj/STP/bin/intent_config`

Features implemented:
- JSON parsing using `jq` (simplified from regex approach)
- Configuration loading hierarchy (global → local → environment)
- Project root detection (supports v0.0.0, v1.2.0, v1.2.1, and v2.0.0)
- Legacy project support (auto-detects stp directory)
- Configuration validation
- Shared functions for all intent commands

### 3. Bootstrap Command: intent_bootstrap
**Location**: `/Users/matts/Devel/prj/STP/bin/intent_bootstrap`

Features implemented:
- Auto-detects INTENT_HOME from script location
- Creates `~/.config/intent/config.json` (XDG standard)
- Provides clear PATH setup instructions
- Supports --force to recreate config
- Runs doctor to verify setup
- Handles existing configs gracefully

### 4. Doctor Command: intent_doctor
**Location**: `/Users/matts/Devel/prj/STP/bin/intent_doctor`

Features implemented:
- Checks INTENT_HOME environment
- Validates intent executable
- Verifies JSON configuration syntax
- Checks PATH includes intent/bin
- Validates required tools (including jq)
- File permission checks (verbose mode)
- --fix mode for automatic repairs
- Clear error/warning reporting with counts

### 5. Main Wrapper: intent
**Location**: `/Users/matts/Devel/prj/STP/bin/intent`

Features implemented:
- Minimal wrapper for Phase 1 testing
- Routes to bootstrap and doctor commands
- Version reporting (2.0.0-alpha)
- Help system
- Ready for expansion in later phases

## Key Design Decision: Using jq

After initially implementing regex-based JSON parsing, we switched to requiring `jq` as a dependency. This decision:
- Simplifies code significantly
- Provides robust JSON handling
- Follows the same pattern as Backlog.md dependency
- Doctor checks for jq and provides installation instructions

## Testing Results

### Command Tests
✅ `intent version` - Shows version 2.0.0-alpha
✅ `intent help` - Displays usage information
✅ `intent bootstrap` - Creates global config successfully
✅ `intent doctor` - Validates configuration correctly
✅ `intent doctor --verbose` - Shows detailed information
✅ `intent doctor --fix` - Can repair issues

### Configuration Tests
✅ Global config loaded from `~/.config/intent/config.json`
✅ Local config overrides global settings
✅ Legacy project detection (STP directory)
✅ v2.0.0 project config (hello-world example)

## Next Steps

Ready for Phase 2: Configuration System
- Enhance config loading for all commands
- Implement project initialization with new structure
- Prepare for migration implementation

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `/bin/intent` - Main command wrapper
- `/bin/intent_bootstrap` - Setup command
- `/bin/intent_doctor` - Diagnostic command
- `/bin/intent_config` - Shared configuration library

### Modified
- Updated to use `jq` for JSON parsing throughout

## Key Insights

1. **jq Dependency**: Much cleaner than regex parsing
2. **Doctor Command**: Essential for troubleshooting
3. **Config Hierarchy**: Works well for global/local settings
4. **Legacy Support**: Auto-detection helps transition
5. **Top-level bin/**: Clear separation from project artifacts

## Time Spent

Phase 1 completed in single session, with mid-course correction to use jq instead of regex parsing.
