# ST0018: Worker-Bee Intent Agent for WDD Architecture Enforcement

## Objective

Create a comprehensive Intent agent that enforces Worker-Bee Driven Design (WDD) architecture principles in Elixir applications through interactive project mapping, automated validation, and intelligent code scaffolding.

## Context

The Intent project's agent system needed a specialized WDD expert to help Elixir developers maintain architectural consistency. Worker-Bee Driven Design is a 6-layer architecture methodology that emphasizes functional programming principles, clear separation of concerns, and maintainable code structure.

This steel thread addresses the need for:
- Automated WDD compliance validation
- Intelligent project structure discovery and mapping
- Educational guidance on WDD principles
- Framework-agnostic support for any Elixir project type
- Integration with Claude Code's sub-agent system

## Context for LLM

This document represents a single steel thread - a self-contained unit of work focused on implementing a specific piece of functionality. When working with an LLM on this steel thread, start by sharing this document to provide context about what needs to be done.

### How to update this document

1. Update the status as work progresses
2. Update related documents (design.md, impl.md, etc.) as needed
3. Mark the completion date when finished

The LLM should assist with implementation details and help maintain this document as work progresses.
