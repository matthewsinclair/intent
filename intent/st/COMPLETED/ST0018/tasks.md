- [x] Ensure agent follows Intent project conventions

## Task Notes

### Critical Success Factors
- **"Discovery Once" Implementation**: Essential for user experience - agent must remember project structure without being intrusive
- **Framework Agnostic Design**: Must work equally well with Phoenix, OTP, libraries, and other Elixir project types
- **Educational Balance**: Agent should teach WDD principles while being practical and actionable
- **Code Generation Quality**: Generated code must follow project conventions and established patterns

### Implementation Approach
Tasks were completed in logical sequence with foundations first (agent definition, core business logic) followed by user-facing features (Mix tasks, documentation). The educational aspect was integrated throughout rather than added as an afterthought.

### Quality Assurance
Each phase included validation that generated code follows WDD principles, ensuring the agent practices what it preaches. All Mix tasks were tested with various project structures to ensure robustness.

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites Completed
- ST0017: Intent Agent System infrastructure (provides agent installation framework)
- Intent v2.2.0 agent management capabilities
- Claude Code sub-agent integration

### External Dependencies
- Elixir/Mix ecosystem for task integration
- YAML library for project mapping persistence
- EEx templating system for code generation
- File system access for project structure discovery

### Internal Dependencies
- Agent definition must be complete before Mix task implementation
- Project mapping system must work before validation can use it
- Business logic modules must be implemented before CLI interfaces
- Templates must be created before scaffolding functionality

### Sequential Requirements
1. Agent foundation (system prompt, metadata) enables Claude Code integration
2. Project mapping system enables all other functionality
3. Validation engine requires mapping system and pattern definitions
4. Scaffolding requires both mapping system and template infrastructure
5. Documentation requires all features to be complete for accurate examples

All dependencies were satisfied during implementation, with the agent now providing comprehensive WDD support for Elixir projects while integrating seamlessly with Intent's project management methodology.
