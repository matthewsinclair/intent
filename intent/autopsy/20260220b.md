# Autopsy Report: 20260220b (Post-Update Verification)

## Summary

- Sessions analyzed: 12 | Compactions: 7 | Date range: 2026-02-17 to 2026-02-20
- Corrections: 4 (1 post-compaction) | Frustration signals: 1
- User flags: 8 | Deferrals: 0 | Banned violations: 98 (3 real, 95 meta-referential)

This is a verification run after the first autopsy (20260220.md) applied 6 memory updates. Same time window, same sessions. Purpose: confirm the updates landed and check for new findings from the current session.

## Verification: Memory Updates Applied

All 6 updates from the first autopsy confirmed in MEMORY.md:

| #   | Update                         | Status  | MEMORY.md line |
| --- | ------------------------------ | ------- | -------------- |
| 1   | Remove test count tracking     | Applied | Line 53        |
| 2   | Add diogenes to subagent list  | Applied | Line 18        |
| 3   | Fix GitHub release workflow    | Applied | Line 8         |
| 4   | Add terminal width principle   | Applied | Line 81        |
| 5   | Add markdown linter convention | Applied | Lines 83-85    |
| 6   | Add interaction pattern        | Applied | Lines 87-90    |

Additionally, the linter added a "Steel Thread Features (ST0022)" section (lines 92-99) documenting the `st new` improvements. This was not proposed by the autopsy but is useful documentation.

## User Flags

All 8 user flags are false positives. Same mechanism as last report: the word "flag" appears in plan documents pasted as user messages and in session continuations.

| Session       | Line | Context                                           |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `00314d4b...` | 2    | ST0022 plan text mentions `--start` flag          |
| `00314d4b...` | 615  | Session continuation summary mentions flags       |
| `a1c29f27...` | 3    | ST0020 plan text mentions flag patterns           |
| `a1c29f27...` | 558  | Session continuation summary references flags     |
| `abd4de73...` | 2    | ST0021 plan text mentions "flag for autopsy"      |
| `abd4de73...` | 657  | Autopsy SKILL.md loaded (contains "flag" in docs) |
| `abd4de73...` | 696  | Session continuation mentions flag documentation  |
| `abd4de73...` | 980  | Autopsy SKILL.md loaded again (2nd invocation)    |

**Finding**: Same as first report. User flag detection fires on plan documents and session continuations. Needs filtering for message length or content type.

## Memory Gaps

No new memory gaps found. The two gaps identified in the first report (brittle test assertions, terminal width principle) have both been addressed in MEMORY.md.

## Enforcement Failures

No enforcement failures. The em dash rule (MEMORY.md line 37) continues to be correctly scoped to skill files only. No em dashes appeared in skill file outputs.

## Undocumented Conventions

### Convention 1: Session wrap-up produces done.md

The session wrap-up workflow (MEMORY.md lines 68-73) lists tasks.md, impl.md, design.md but does not mention done.md. This session created done.md files for ST0020, ST0021, and ST0022 as part of the "move done work out of tasks.md" pattern.

- Proposed MEMORY.md update (line 69):
  ```
  - Update ST docs (tasks.md, done.md, impl.md, design.md) with as-built state
  ```
  Already updated in this session. No further action needed.

### Convention 2: Autopsy reports use date-suffixed filenames for multiple runs

This session produced `20260220.md` (first run) and `20260220b.md` (verification run). The naming convention for multiple autopsy runs on the same day is not documented.

- Not worth a MEMORY.md entry -- too niche.

## Stale Memory

No stale rules identified. All MEMORY.md sections were relevant to activity in the analyzed sessions:

- Project Overview, Key Paths, Command Architecture: referenced throughout
- Skills System: core to ST0020 and ST0021
- Treeindex System: referenced in treeindex regeneration
- BATS Test Patterns: relevant to ST0020 WP-11 and ST0021 WP-03
- Git Commit Rules: enforced in every session
- Session Wrap-up Workflow: executed in this session
- Known Issues: subagent sync false-positive still unfixed
- Display Principles, Markdown Linter, Interaction Pattern: all new from first autopsy, relevant

## Correction Pairs

| #   | Session       | Line | Post-compact | User excerpt                                                 | Assistant acknowledgment                                              |
| --- | ------------- | ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `1228a7c5...` | 270  | No           | (WP-11 plan -- Claude realized count assertion was brittle)  | "You're right -- asserting an exact count is brittle and meaningless" |
| 2   | `1228a7c5...` | 696  | **Yes**      | "add a new Claude Subagent called Autopsy... read here..."   | "Good, I've read everything. Here's what I've learned..."             |
| 3   | `a1c29f27...` | 438  | No           | (ST0020 plan -- Claude caught missing routing + stale dates) | "Good catch. Let me update the routing and fix all 2024 dates"        |
| 4   | `adce1001...` | 278  | No           | "Why not use the terminal full available width to truncate?" | "Tests pass, but you're right -- tput cols returns 80 in sandbox..."  |

Correction #2 remains a false positive -- "Good" was an acknowledgment of reading material, not error correction.

**Real corrections**: #1 (brittle test assertion) and #4 (terminal width truncation). Both pre-compaction. Both resulted in code changes. Both now have matching MEMORY.md rules.

## Frustration Signals

| Session       | Line | Signals                                                          | Post-compact | Context                                                     |
| ------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `abd4de73...` | 2    | how many times, I told you, you forgot, wrong file, did you look | No           | False positive: ST0021 plan text contains these as examples |

**All frustration signals are false positives** -- from the autopsy plan document listing detection patterns as examples.

## Deferrals

None detected. Zero deferrals across 12 sessions.

## Banned Pattern Violations

### Real violations (3)

Same as first report. No new real violations.

| Session       | Line | Pattern      | Label  | Source       | Context                                                |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------ | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `a1c29f27...` | 850  | "Absolutely" | ai_ism | conversation | "Absolutely right -- that AGENTS-phx.md content..."    |
| `a1c29f27...` | 1555 | "Absolutely" | ai_ism | conversation | "You're absolutely right -- this is an obvious gap..." |
| `a1c29f27...` | 185  | "overall"    | filler | tool_use     | "principles govern the overall structure of Elixir..." |

### Meta-referential violations (95)

95 violations from sessions `1228a7c5...` and `abd4de73...` where autopsy plan/code was being written or run. These sessions reference banned words as examples in plans, write banned-words.txt content, and discuss detection patterns. All from tool_use:Write, tool_use:Edit, tool_use:ExitPlanMode, tool_use:AskUserQuestion, tool_use:Bash, or user messages pasting plans.

This is up from 81 in the first report because the current session (`abd4de73...`) accumulated additional messages (session continuation, second autopsy invocation) that re-reference the banned word list.

## Second Pass

### Missed corrections

Reviewed user messages with emphasis or re-statements beyond the 4 detected. One candidate from the current session:

- User said "Hang on, 21 should be updated as complete" -- this is a correction of omission (I marked ST0020 as done but forgot ST0021). However, this occurred after the script's data cutoff for this session, so it does not appear in the findings.

### Deep scan

The 3 real banned violations are unchanged from the first report:

- "Absolutely" (2x in conversation) -- intensifier before agreement. Low severity.
- "overall" (1x in tool_use:Write) -- technical document about Elixir architecture. Contextually appropriate.

### Deferral legitimacy

No deferrals to evaluate. Clean.

## Proposed Memory Updates

None. All gaps from the first autopsy have been addressed. The MEMORY.md is current and accurate.

**Observation**: The autopsy system is working as designed -- the first run identified 6 actionable updates, they were applied, and this verification run confirms they landed with no new gaps.
