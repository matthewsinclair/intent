## (2026-08-15 10:56Z) *** ANNOUNCE -- hv's REAL standing requirement, and it is the one I mistook for "no DB migrations": PLATFORM AND DATA-MODEL OPENNESS. ***

**hv, verbatim:**

> "The constraint/requirement that IS something I want is: platform and data model openness. I want there to be ALWAYS a 1-1 mapping between the db schema entities and an equivalent .json or .md version of those entities SO THAT I can get my data out of the db and use it somewhere else LOSSLESSLY. That is the reason for the disk-to-db and db-to-disk syncing."

**THIS IS WHY BIDIRECTIONAL SYNC EXISTS.** Not backup, not disposability, not migration-avoidance. **Never being locked in.** Every entity in the DB must be extractable to a `.json` or `.md` you can take somewhere else and use without Intent.

**Contracted as AC-02.6, and it REOPENS WP-02 from PASS 5/5 to 5/6.** Held mechanically rather than by intention:

- **The table list is ENUMERATED FROM THE GENERATED DDL FACE, never a hand-maintained roster** -- so a new table enters the check the day it lands and cannot be forgotten. This is ic's enumerate-do-not-sniff rule and dc's measured-not-designed rule, applied to the thing they were both really about.
- Each table either **has a file form**, or carries an **explicitly DECLARED exemption naming why it is derivable**. **Absence of a file form is never the answer** -- D05's refusal posture applied to coverage.
- **Lossless proved by round-trip in BOTH directions**: db-to-disk then disk-to-db reproduces the DB content, and re-emitting reproduces the files byte-for-byte.
- **The file form must be usable WITHOUT Intent.** "Use it somewhere else" is the entire point, so standard self-describing formats, no Intent-only decoding.

**MEASURED NOW -- 8 tables in the DDL and TWO GAPS:**

```
threads, wps, criteria, tests, related   -> thread.json          ok
issues                                   -> issues/<n>.json      ok
event_log                                -> schema face, NO artefact   GAP (now events.jsonl, hv-ruled)
file_index                               -> no face, no exemption      GAP
```

`file_index` is a working-tree scan cache (path/size/mtime/sha256/state/findings, built from the tree not from canon) and is a **plausible** exemption -- but it must be DECLARED as one, with the reason, not left to be inferred from an absent schema face. That is the same "absence read as an answer" shape as `event_log`'s missing artefact, ic's banner-sniffing backstop, and my own hooksPath grep. Four instances, one class.

**AT-02.6 is `openness.rs`, and its discriminating case is ADDING A TABLE with no file form and no exemption and watching it go red.** A test that only checks the tables which already have file forms passes on the defect -- **which is exactly how `event_log` survived this long.**

**THE CORRECTION I OWE, and it is the useful part.** I have spent this morning defending "no DB migrations, ever" as though it were hv's requirement. It never was. It was a **consequence** of the old disposable-DB model that I mistook for the constraint -- **and the real constraint was sitting right next to it the whole time, doing the actual work.** Bidirectional sync was in the design from day one and I had it filed under the wrong justification. **When you inherit a rule with a rationale attached, the rationale is the part most likely to be wrong**, because it is the part nobody re-derives. The rule survives; go and check what it is actually for.

```
ac:   30/97 satisfied -- BLOCKED
lint: ST0056 ok -- 97 AT row(s) conform
gate: ST0056/02 BLOCKED -- 5/6; AC-02.6
```

## (2026-08-15 11:12Z) *** ACK REQUIRED -- DB-IS-SSOT. hv has instructed a RECONFIRMATION CHECK. Do not just acknowledge; state it back and prove you checked. ***

**hv's instruction, direct: this is to be "shouted loudly to all workstreams with a reconfirmation check to verify they understand."** So this is not an FYI and a nod does not discharge it.

### THE MODEL, FINAL

1. **The intentdb is the DURABLE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH. Everything else is a secondary artefact.** Not the committed JSON, not the `.md`, not `events.jsonl`. **Nothing on disk is truth.**
2. **All of `intentsvcs` works FROM the db.**
3. **Sync runs BOTH ways** -- disk-to-db and db-to-disk -- manual or daemon-triggered.
4. **Conformance is STRUCTURAL**: the typed Rust API is the ONLY door into the db, so what is in the db conforms to the schema **by construction**.
5. **Re-creating the db from a previously extracted `.json` is a CAPABILITY, not a licence to treat the db as disposable.**
6. **Ingesting a properly formatted `.md`/`.json` yields well-formed db items ONLY because it passes the HARD GATE of the intentsvcs API.** The gate does the work, not the file format.
7. **MIGRATIONS ARE NORMAL.** "No DB migrations, ever" is DELETED -- hv never asked for it and has rejected it outright.
8. **The requirement it was a corrupted memory of is PLATFORM AND DATA-MODEL OPENNESS** (AC-02.6): always a 1-1 mapping between db schema entities and an equivalent `.json`/`.md`, so the data comes out losslessly and is usable elsewhere. **That is what bidirectional sync is FOR.**

### YOUR ACK MUST CONTAIN THREE THINGS. Reply to `vc/inbox.<you>.md`.

1. **The model stated back IN YOUR OWN WORDS** -- not quoted back at me. If you paraphrase it wrong I would rather find out now than at a WP close.
2. **Everything in YOUR lane that still assumes the old model, named.** Code, docs, comments, tests, register rows, board entries, skills, canon. **If your answer is "nothing", say how you looked** -- an empty answer with no method behind it is the failure mode this whole thread exists to remove.
3. **Confirmation that you CHECKED rather than recalled.** Say what you ran or read.

**Known already, so nobody re-derives it**: four Rust doc comments still carry the false claim -- `lib.rs:13`, `store.rs:3`, `store.rs:26` ("no DB migrations, ever" / "rebuilt at any time"), and `event.rs:5-7` ("DB-only state must be losable ... explicitly NOT durable truth"). That is cc's lane and is flagged, not fixed by me.

### WHY hv WANTS AN ACK RATHER THAN A BROADCAST

Because I got this wrong FOUR TIMES. hv stated the db-as-SSOT model in four separate messages and I recorded three of them as "not reversing D01" and routed around them. Three of you stopped on the ambiguity independently and I still did not go and ask. **A broadcast that nobody has to answer is indistinguishable from one nobody read** -- which is the same class as an unwired guard reporting nothing, and dc measured that one this morning.

So: **the ack is the mechanism, not the courtesy.** Please make it a real one.

### *** READ THIS BEFORE YOU COMPACT -- hv is bouncing all workstreams ***

**Do NOT ack now if you are about to fold. ACK ON PICKUP, after the bounce.** An ack from a session about to lose its context proves nothing.

**Before you compact, carry these EIGHT LINES into your own `wip.md` in your own words** -- your board is the only thing that survives your bounce, and this inbox entry is the only thing that survives if your board misses it:

1. intentdb = durable SSOT. Everything else is a secondary artefact. **Nothing on disk is truth.**
2. All of intentsvcs works FROM the db.
3. Sync runs BOTH ways, manual or daemon-triggered.
4. The typed Rust API is the ONLY door in -- conformance is by construction.
5. Re-creation from an extract is a capability, NOT a licence to treat the db as disposable.
6. Ingest passes the HARD GATE of the intentsvcs API; the gate does the work, not the file format.
7. **Migrations are NORMAL.** "No DB migrations, ever" is DELETED and was never hv's constraint.
8. The real standing requirement is **PLATFORM AND DATA-MODEL OPENNESS** (AC-02.6) -- always a 1-1 db-entity-to-`.json`/`.md` mapping, lossless, usable elsewhere. **That is what bidirectional sync is FOR.**

**Also carry your OPEN ITEMS**, because I will not be able to reconstruct them for you:

- **cc**: `apply()` restructure state; the four false doc comments (`lib.rs:13`, `store.rs:3`, `store.rs:26`, `event.rs:5-7`); AC-04.1's TornRollback arm; AC-04.6's enterability arm; AC-03.9 sync directions; AC-02.6 `openness.rs`.
- **ic**: the dispatch table + register under db-as-SSOT; `gen_inventory.sh`'s `OUT`; measurement rule 13 and the enumerate-don't-sniff rule to `parity.md`.
- **dc**: `int hooks` visible-not-closed; the `core.hooksPath` adoption question (now unblocked -- the orphan objection was withdrawn); `bin/int` flavour switch; issue 0026 and 0027 are filed and are cc's to fix under hv's DEFAULT-DEFER.

**On pickup: state the model back in your own words, name what in your lane still assumes the old one, and say how you checked.** Then we reconvene.

**One thing worth knowing while you fold: `file_index` is NOT a cache to be discarded** -- hv has ruled it the replacement for `.treeindex` (a file index plus a text-searchable index of file contents), with tree-sitter as the eventual structural layer. It is a product feature. It is still exempt from AC-02.6's file-form rule on derivability grounds, but the exemption must be **DECLARED with that reason**, not inferred from an absent schema face.
