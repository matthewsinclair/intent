## (2026-08-15 10:56Z) *** ANNOUNCE -- hv's REAL standing requirement, and it is the one I mistook for "no DB migrations": PLATFORM AND DATA-MODEL OPENNESS. ***

**hv, verbatim:**

> "The constraint/requirement that IS something I want is: platform and data model openness. I want there to be ALWAYS a 1-1 mapping between the db schema entities and an equivalent .json or .md version of those entities SO THAT I can get my data out of the db and use it somewhere else LOSSLESSLY. That is the reason for the disk-to-db and db-to-disk syncing."

**THIS IS WHY BIDIRECTIONAL SYNC EXISTS.** Not backup, not disposability, not migration-avoidance. **Never being locked in.** Every entity in the DB must be extractable to a `.json` or `.md` you can take somewhere else and use without Intent.

**Contracted as AC-02.6, and it REOPENS WP-02 from PASS 5/5 to 5/6.** Held mechanically rather than by intention:

- **The table list is ENUMERATED FROM THE GENERATED DDL FACE, never a hand-maintained roster** -- so a new table enters the check the day it lands and cannot be forgotten. This is ic's enumerate-do-not-sniff rule and dc's measured-not-designed rule, applied to the thing they were both really about.
- Each table either **has a file form**, or carries an **explicitly DECLARED exemption naming why it is derivable**. **Absence of a file form is never the answer** -- D05's refusal posture applied to coverage.
- **Lossless proved by round-trip in BOTH directions**: db-to-disk then disk-to-db reproduces the DB content, and re-emitting reproduces the files byte-for-byte.
- **The file form must be usable WITHOUT Intent.** "Use it somewhere else" is the entire point, so standard self-describing formats, no Intent-only decoding.

**MEASURED NOW -- 8 tables in the DDL and TWO GAPS:**

```
threads, wps, criteria, tests, related   -> thread.json          ok
issues                                   -> issues/<n>.json      ok
event_log                                -> schema face, NO artefact   GAP (now events.jsonl, hv-ruled)
file_index                               -> no face, no exemption      GAP
```

`file_index` is a working-tree scan cache (path/size/mtime/sha256/state/findings, built from the tree not from canon) and is a **plausible** exemption -- but it must be DECLARED as one, with the reason, not left to be inferred from an absent schema face. That is the same "absence read as an answer" shape as `event_log`'s missing artefact, ic's banner-sniffing backstop, and my own hooksPath grep. Four instances, one class.

**AT-02.6 is `openness.rs`, and its discriminating case is ADDING A TABLE with no file form and no exemption and watching it go red.** A test that only checks the tables which already have file forms passes on the defect -- **which is exactly how `event_log` survived this long.**

**THE CORRECTION I OWE, and it is the useful part.** I have spent this morning defending "no DB migrations, ever" as though it were hv's requirement. It never was. It was a **consequence** of the old disposable-DB model that I mistook for the constraint -- **and the real constraint was sitting right next to it the whole time, doing the actual work.** Bidirectional sync was in the design from day one and I had it filed under the wrong justification. **When you inherit a rule with a rationale attached, the rationale is the part most likely to be wrong**, because it is the part nobody re-derives. The rule survives; go and check what it is actually for.
