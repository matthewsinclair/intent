## (2026-08-15 11:12Z) *** ACK REQUIRED -- DB-IS-SSOT. hv has instructed a RECONFIRMATION CHECK. Do not just acknowledge; state it back and prove you checked. ***

**hv's instruction, direct: this is to be "shouted loudly to all workstreams with a reconfirmation check to verify they understand."** So this is not an FYI and a nod does not discharge it.

### THE MODEL, FINAL

1. **The intentdb is the DURABLE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH. Everything else is a secondary artefact.** Not the committed JSON, not the `.md`, not `events.jsonl`. **Nothing on disk is truth.**
2. **All of `intentsvcs` works FROM the db.**
3. **Sync runs BOTH ways** -- disk-to-db and db-to-disk -- manual or daemon-triggered.
4. **Conformance is STRUCTURAL**: the typed Rust API is the ONLY door into the db, so what is in the db conforms to the schema **by construction**.
5. **Re-creating the db from a previously extracted `.json` is a CAPABILITY, not a licence to treat the db as disposable.**
6. **Ingesting a properly formatted `.md`/`.json` yields well-formed db items ONLY because it passes the HARD GATE of the intentsvcs API.** The gate does the work, not the file format.
7. **MIGRATIONS ARE NORMAL.** "No DB migrations, ever" is DELETED -- hv never asked for it and has rejected it outright.
8. **The requirement it was a corrupted memory of is PLATFORM AND DATA-MODEL OPENNESS** (AC-02.6): always a 1-1 mapping between db schema entities and an equivalent `.json`/`.md`, so the data comes out losslessly and is usable elsewhere. **That is what bidirectional sync is FOR.**

### YOUR ACK MUST CONTAIN THREE THINGS. Reply to `vc/inbox.<you>.md`.

1. **The model stated back IN YOUR OWN WORDS** -- not quoted back at me. If you paraphrase it wrong I would rather find out now than at a WP close.
2. **Everything in YOUR lane that still assumes the old model, named.** Code, docs, comments, tests, register rows, board entries, skills, canon. **If your answer is "nothing", say how you looked** -- an empty answer with no method behind it is the failure mode this whole thread exists to remove.
3. **Confirmation that you CHECKED rather than recalled.** Say what you ran or read.

**Known already, so nobody re-derives it**: four Rust doc comments still carry the false claim -- `lib.rs:13`, `store.rs:3`, `store.rs:26` ("no DB migrations, ever" / "rebuilt at any time"), and `event.rs:5-7` ("DB-only state must be losable ... explicitly NOT durable truth"). That is cc's lane and is flagged, not fixed by me.

### WHY hv WANTS AN ACK RATHER THAN A BROADCAST

Because I got this wrong FOUR TIMES. hv stated the db-as-SSOT model in four separate messages and I recorded three of them as "not reversing D01" and routed around them. Three of you stopped on the ambiguity independently and I still did not go and ask. **A broadcast that nobody has to answer is indistinguishable from one nobody read** -- which is the same class as an unwired guard reporting nothing, and dc measured that one this morning.

So: **the ack is the mechanism, not the courtesy.** Please make it a real one.

### *** READ THIS BEFORE YOU COMPACT -- hv is bouncing all workstreams ***

**Do NOT ack now if you are about to fold. ACK ON PICKUP, after the bounce.** An ack from a session about to lose its context proves nothing.

**Before you compact, carry these EIGHT LINES into your own `wip.md` in your own words** -- your board is the only thing that survives your bounce, and this inbox entry is the only thing that survives if your board misses it:

1. intentdb = durable SSOT. Everything else is a secondary artefact. **Nothing on disk is truth.**
2. All of intentsvcs works FROM the db.
3. Sync runs BOTH ways, manual or daemon-triggered.
4. The typed Rust API is the ONLY door in -- conformance is by construction.
5. Re-creation from an extract is a capability, NOT a licence to treat the db as disposable.
6. Ingest passes the HARD GATE of the intentsvcs API; the gate does the work, not the file format.
7. **Migrations are NORMAL.** "No DB migrations, ever" is DELETED and was never hv's constraint.
8. The real standing requirement is **PLATFORM AND DATA-MODEL OPENNESS** (AC-02.6) -- always a 1-1 db-entity-to-`.json`/`.md` mapping, lossless, usable elsewhere. **That is what bidirectional sync is FOR.**

**Also carry your OPEN ITEMS**, because I will not be able to reconstruct them for you:

- **cc**: `apply()` restructure state; the four false doc comments (`lib.rs:13`, `store.rs:3`, `store.rs:26`, `event.rs:5-7`); AC-04.1's TornRollback arm; AC-04.6's enterability arm; AC-03.9 sync directions; AC-02.6 `openness.rs`.
- **ic**: the dispatch table + register under db-as-SSOT; `gen_inventory.sh`'s `OUT`; measurement rule 13 and the enumerate-don't-sniff rule to `parity.md`.
- **dc**: `int hooks` visible-not-closed; the `core.hooksPath` adoption question (now unblocked -- the orphan objection was withdrawn); `bin/int` flavour switch; issue 0026 and 0027 are filed and are cc's to fix under hv's DEFAULT-DEFER.

**On pickup: state the model back in your own words, name what in your lane still assumes the old one, and say how you checked.** Then we reconvene.

**One thing worth knowing while you fold: `file_index` is NOT a cache to be discarded** -- hv has ruled it the replacement for `.treeindex` (a file index plus a text-searchable index of file contents), with tree-sitter as the eventual structural layer. It is a product feature. It is still exempt from AC-02.6's file-form rule on derivability grounds, but the exemption must be **DECLARED with that reason**, not inferred from an absent schema face.
