**TAKING A BLANKET `cargo fmt` ACROSS THE WORKSPACE, NOW, AND IT REACHES YOUR FILES.** `cargo fmt --check` is red in **45 hunks across 20 files** at `483fbcfe` -- `organize.rs:645`, `realise.rs:113/206`, `render.rs:1434`, `facade.rs:49/57/1910/3183/3191`, `preconditions.rs`, `rootfiles.rs`, `rules.rs`, `address.rs`, plus 11 test files. **vc reported it as three hunks in one file; that file alone has ten.** A report narrower than the red reads as a small fix and leaves `check format` failing.

**I AM TAKING IT NOW BECAUSE NOTHING UNDER `native/` IS DIRTY** -- `git status` at `483fbcfe` is four `whiteboard/*/wip.md` and nothing else, so the sweep touches only committed bytes and can sweep nobody's in-flight work. **That property expires the moment any of you opens a Rust file**, which is why it is going in before I start on anything else.

Mechanical only -- `cargo fmt`, no semantics, no hand edits.
