# DevX Claude (dc)

## DOING

- **Two fixes to `intent wb migrate`, approved by vc 2026-09-13, each its own landing with one arm, both before Laksa or Courses run their cutover.** (1) A failed reconciliation exits NON-ZERO after printing everything: today it prints `error:` and exits 0, so the exit code is blind to the one invariant the verb exists to keep. (2) `views.rs` becomes the one home for both empty sentinels, `_(none)_` and `_(empty)_`; the reader imports them and reads a sentinel-only section as empty: today it carried hv's two `_(none)_` lines as a doing and a todo item.

## TODO

- **Later, on vc's signal only**: one preflight line running ic's `contract_check.sh` (`intent/st/ST0056/parity/tools/contract_check.sh`; 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 environment/usage). **ROSTERED MANUAL, not gated** -- it exits 1 today on whiteboard faces cc has not built, which vc ruled stands. Positive-control it with its `MODEL` override before trusting a green, and keep exit 1 and exit 2 distinct in whatever the release script prints.

## Holds

- **The tap formula commit `9987a93` is local and unpushed.** Condition: hv approves that push, as its own action.
- **A HOLD WHOSE STATED CAUSE IS WRONG STILL READS AS A HOLD.** Re-drive a hold's condition when you quote it; never read it off this line.

## Watch-outs

- **A SECTION NOTHING MAPS USED TO RETURN BEFORE ITS LINES WERE COUNTED**, so they entered no denominator and the reconciliation was a claim about the sections the reader already understood. **A denominator that excludes what the instrument cannot see agrees with itself perfectly.** Count where the unit is dispatched, whatever becomes of it.
- **SEVEN `intent-cli` ARMS REFUSE AT ONCE WHEN THE BUILT `intentd` IS OLDER THAN `intentsvcs`' SOURCES**, panicking in `common/mod.rs` with nothing about the tests in the message. It is the harness's own staleness guard and it is right. `cargo build -p intentd` before any `-p intent-cli` run that follows a library edit. It reads exactly like a regression and is not one.
- **AN EXIT-CODE ASSERTION IS ABOUT THE WHOLE ESTATE THE FIXTURE LEAVES.** 0313's arm planted a stale store with `write_thread`, which also skews every generated view -- and view skew blocks -- so the exit code would have been 1 for a reason with nothing to do with the arm, and would have passed for the wrong reason if the class were ever put back. Seed the fixture so the thing under test is the only thing wrong.
- **A NEW MECHANISM HAS NO BASELINE TO REDDEN, SO MUTATE THE IMPLEMENTATION INSTEAD.** Six mutations this session, each reddening the arm it should: holds as `Todo`, snapshots unwritten, the claimed stamp dropped, the unregistered-sender check removed, an unmapped section dropped rather than named, and `legacy` carried across a re-cite.
- **SETTLE A DAEMON-FAMILY RED BY THE SHAPE OF THE FAILING SET, NOT BY RE-RUNNING TWICE.** Different arms red in each of two runs at loads of 85 and 49 is the load signature; a STABLE failing set is the one that means something. Structural dismissal needs the change provably unable to reach the arm -- verified, never asserted.
- **`git apply --3way` ONTO A TREE THREE PEERS ARE WRITING NEEDS THE LOCK LOOP, AND THE LOOP IS `until [ ! -f .git/index.lock ]`.** Chained `sleep`s are refused by the harness; re-issue the SAME command after the wait, never a recomposed one.
- **Shared checkout: `git add <paths> && git commit --only <paths>` in ONE call**, literal paths. Peers stage files mid-commit; `--only` is what keeps their work out of my landing. Three peers were landing into this tree all session and nothing of theirs reached my commits.
- **Every suite and build from the private worktree with its IN-TREE target dir** under an isolated HOME, `CARGO_HOME` at the real one. Rebase the worktree onto main before measuring, or the numbers describe a tree nobody has.
- **D42: a clock value goes into a board or a message only from a `date -u` read in the SAME CALL as the write.**
- **The Bash tool's shell is zsh**: unquoted `$var` does not word-split, an unquoted `--include=*.rs` aborts the whole command, and messages go in a file through `-F`.

## Decisions

- (2026-09-13) **`authored_at` is a PARAMETER on the two shipped wb insert writers, not a second INSERT beside them.** One insert per table: two spellings of one row is how one door ends up carrying a field the other drops, and the drift is invisible because each door is self-consistent. The service still reads the clock for `recorded_at` in the same statement and has no parameter for it.
- (2026-09-13) **A `.history/` snapshot is a DOCUMENT and gets its own half of the prose table (`wb_node`), scoped per node.** The canon ingest's wholesale replace cannot reach it and neither can the file indexer's, which is the arrangement `owner_type` already exists to make possible. The alternative -- canon-half rows re-derived from disk at every ingest -- would have put a node's history on the wrong side of a `DELETE` that runs constantly.
- (2026-09-13) **`StoreStale` is its own finding class because a DERIVED cache being behind says nothing about what a commit carries.** On a shared tree it is the normal state for the duration of every peer's write, and a refusal that clears itself with nobody acting teaches nodes to re-run gates.
- (2026-09-12) **WP-02's prune refusal is ALL OR NOTHING with the estate as the unit.** One unheld path refuses every removal and names each one. The conservative direction, and the refusal names the file and the remedy.
- devbin `0047` (hv, 2026-09-01): option 3, the split. Relayed to devbin-vc, who own `bin/.devbin/lib/`; the vendored copy here is overwritten on upgrade, so it is never mine to implement. UNEXECUTED, and not dc's.
