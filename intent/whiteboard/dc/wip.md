# DevX Claude (dc)

**Today's reasoning, dead ends and perishable measurements are verbatim in `.history/20260821/wip.md` -- the afternoon session is appended under its own heading. This file is the COLD-SESSION MINIMUM.**

## D42 -- TIME. Read this before writing anything, anywhere.

- **You never ask what time it is** -- not the OS, not `date`, not the filesystem, **and not the database either.** The stamp is applied BY the write.
- **THE RULE IS ABOUT SIGNATURES, NOT VALUES. NO cli or intentsvcs function TAKES a time; they may RETURN times.**
- **A board stamp is a label, not data** -- read it from `date -u` and PASTE, **per stamp, never per session.** The ordering that cannot be fabricated is the **commit**.

## The truth model -- canon, held not restated

`design.md` (D01 as reversed) + `data-model.md`. **The SQLite db is the durable SSOT, files are re-creatable; the typed API is the only door in.** **`intentdb` IS RETIRED AND NAMES NO COMPONENT.** The crates are `intent-cli`, `intentd`, `intentsvcs`; `intentsvcs` solely owns the db and `intentd` is a CLIENT exactly as the CLI is. Diagram `design.md:12-17`.

## The environment

- **v2 LIVES IN `~/Devel/prj/Intentv2`** (`v2-maintenance` at `fb45e9ea`). **Its gate was ARM C LIVE and I repaired it** -- dispatcher was absent, `gate ABSENT` -> `WIRED`, planted violation now `rc=1 / guards: 4 ran, 0 skipped`.
- **`intent` ON PATH IS v2.19.0. Drive v3 explicitly: `./native/rust/target/debug/intent`.**
- **`.envrc` EXISTS AND IS BLOCKED -- it does NOTHING until hv runs `direnv allow`.** Even then it fires only at an interactive prompt: **every node commits through non-interactive tool calls, so it is inert for us.**
- **`int hooks` ANSWERS ABOUT THE TREE THE `int` SCRIPT LIVES IN, NOT YOUR CWD.** It now warns when they differ (`1005ab88`). To ask about another clone, run ITS `bin/int`.

## DOING

**Nothing in flight. AC-01.5 form 1 landed at `5c7bb80f`; the row is vc's to verify.** Working tree carries only peers' work. No `target/dc` exists, so prune-at-fold is vacuous for me a third day.

**NOT PUBLISHING A GATE FIGURE.** cc's clean-room ingest at HEAD is the number all four of us are holding for. Both `63`s published today were arithmetic in opposite directions from the same figure, and my own `64` was a store read over four dirty worktrees.

## TODO

### 1. ST0057 AC-01.5 -- BUILT AND LANDED AT `5c7bb80f`. vc's TO VERIFY.

**THREE FILES, NOT TWO, AND THE THIRD IS THE ONE EVERY LIST MISSED:** `.githooks/pre-commit` (instance), `intent_claude_upgrade`'s `canon_emit_chain_block` (**the SOURCE -- generator first, or the next `claude upgrade` overwrites it**; verified byte-identical, 1271 bytes both sides, independently by vc), and `bin/.devbin/cmd/hooks`, whose prose said the block _"skips a missing gate SILENTLY"_ -- **which form 1 made false. Dead prose beside a live disposition is part of the change, not a follow-up.**

**RED/GREEN IN ONE CLONE AT `6edbd24f`, same staged violation, one file swapped:** old block **rc=0, commit LANDED `e5111788`, 82 lines**; new block **rc=1, REFUSED, HEAD unmoved, 9 lines**. Four arms driven in isolation first, **including the positive control** (present+executable -> runs, hook continues). `5c7bb80f` then passed through its own new block on its first real commit.

**FORM 2 IS NOT REDUNDANT AND I NEARLY WROTE THAT IT WAS.** The block only speaks when the hook RUNS, which needs `core.hooksPath` already set; `int hooks` answers in exactly the state -- hooksPath unset -- where the block is unreachable. **I caught it only because writing the sentence out forced the precondition explicit. That is an argument for writing justifications down, not for my judgement.**

**hv ACCEPTED THE WEDGE ("refuse is correct") AND AUTHORISED THE COMMIT DIRECTLY IN MY SESSION.** vc relayed the acceptance and **explicitly refused to relay a landing authority** -- record it that way. **Warn-and-continue was defeated by my own 82-line measurement:** the `ok:` lines still print below a warning, so it reproduces the defect with more text.

**BLAST RADIUS CLOSED TWO WAYS.** Structurally, from the planner (`intent_claude_upgrade:909-920`): **the block is never inserted while the dispatcher is absent** -- `CHAIN_PRE_COMMIT_BLOCK` is planned only where `pre-commit.intent` is already present AND matches canon; the other three sites install it immediately above. Empirically (vc): **`Intentv2`, the copy the FLEET resolves to, still carries the bare block**, so no consumer sees this until v3 ships. **The structural argument would have been true and useless had the fleet already picked it up.**

### 2. THE GUARD-RESOLUTION MECHANISM -- STILL OPEN, AND THE `.envrc` DID NOT CLOSE IT

Recorded on hv's board as mine and OPEN. **Driven: in a non-interactive shell `INTENT_HOME` is still `Intentv2`, so this repo's guards resolve out of the frozen v2 tree.** All six guard files are byte-identical today; drift starts at the next guard change.

**MY PROPOSED FIX, NOT YET PUT TO hv: a self-hosted Intent checkout resolves guards from its OWN tracked `lib/templates/hooks/`, never from `$INTENT_HOME`.** No environment dependency, works in hooks and tests and tool calls, can name the tree it resolved from, and leaves consumer projects on the `$INTENT_HOME` path unchanged. **hv declined direnv and hand-refresh BY NAME; a wrong answer must be LOUD.**

### 3. ROUTED OUT, NOT MINE TO BUILD

- **`sync` skips untracked bytes, LOUDLY (hv ruled, I put four options).** Handed to cc 15:33Z -- **`sync` is Rust and Rust is cc's lane.** Warning must stop saying _the commit gate will_ refuse, and must not fire on the syncing node's OWN new file (staged-but-untracked and untracked-and-unstaged are different states).
- **AC-03.6 is cc's row to green.** Blocker cleared by `5d2b1f0d`; evidence handed over 15:26Z. **I will not certify my own wiring.**

### 4. MINE AND UNSTARTED

- **`cmd/macos` provenance writer** so `provenance_fields_check.sh` has a green to reach. **TRAP FOUND, NOT YET WALKED INTO: `codesign --force` REWRITES THE BINARY IN PLACE, so a hash taken at STAGE time never matches shipped bytes** (`cmd/macos:882-895`); nothing may hash until `verify_notarised` passes. **And `:1294` parses `commit:` with a `sed` -- ADD fields, never rename that one, or `publish` breaks.**
- **`thread_view_skew_check.sh` admission -- STILL HELD, AND I DECLINED hv's RELEASE ON THE MERITS.** Re-derived: release binary `2026-08-20 15:01` vs `migrate.rs`/`facade.rs` `2026-08-20 17:57`, **2h56m stale and unchanged.** The staleness refusal it is conditional on does not exist. Build `lib_binstale.sh` as an EXTRACTION of `surface_check.sh`, never a copy.
- **AT-11.6 BLOCKED** on the contract conflict routed to vc. The live unattributable pair is still in the gate output every commit.
- **WP-07 hosting sweep** needs a driven re-measure through `render.rs:495`; the disposition route is a DEAD END.

## Watch-outs

**Today's instances are verbatim in `.history/20260821/wip.md`. These are the CLASSES.**

- **A RULE APPLIED TO THE LANE IT NAMES INSTEAD OF TO THE PROPERTY THAT MAKES IT MATTER.** My own standing decision reads _announce to cc before touching `bin/`_. **`.githooks/` is not `bin/`, so I did not announce -- and the reason for the rule is STRONGER there, not weaker.** A lane is a proxy for a property; when the two come apart, the property governs. ic caught it by naming two files they did not recognise rather than sweeping them.
- **`.githooks/pre-commit` IS THE ONE FILE WHERE AN UNCOMMITTED EDIT EXECUTES FOR EVERY PEER IMMEDIATELY** (ic, 2026-08-21). `core.hooksPath` points at the **WORKTREE**. For `surface/dispatch-table.json` -- where the announce rule was minted -- a peer's dirty copy affects nobody until they read it. **Here, every node's next commit runs yours, with nobody opting in.** ic's `6edbd24f` and two of cc's went through my uncommitted edit before anyone knew it existed. Not "someone might read a stale file" but **"everyone executes yours"**.
- **A FILE LIST HAS A TIMESTAMP AND DECAYS** (ic's correction, in my favour). Their "neither mine nor cc's" sweep named two files at ~15:53Z; my third was modified at 15:54Z. **"The list was short by one" and "the tree grew a file under the list" have different remedies, and only the second was true.** In a four-writer checkout a `git status` is stale the moment it prints -- which is why the sender announces FILES rather than the reader sweeping for them.
- **A FILTER THAT DROPS THE SUBJECT LINE TURNS A CORRECT REPORT INTO A CONFIDENT WRONG ONE.** `int hooks` names its tree on line 1; I grepped for `gate|WIRED` and **produced three false findings from one true report.** Before believing any tool, check it is answering about the thing you are standing in.
- **A FALSE CONFESSION IS CAUGHT BY NOTHING WE OWN** (vc's, and I was the real cause). Every rule we have guards claims that FAVOUR the claimant. **A claim that inconveniently blames you passes every check, because owning a fault reads as rigour and gets no audit.** Check a self-accusation as hard as a self-serving one.
- **A BARE `git reset` IS A SHARED-INDEX OPERATION** -- no pathspec means every peer's stage. Our rule names `--only` and says nothing about this. **`--only` DOES preserve a peer stage, both directions, driven by vc.**
- **`sync --to-disk <ID>` REWRITES EVERY ATTACHMENT FILE OF THAT THREAD FROM THE STORE.** A whole-file second writer over peers' uncommitted work. **I nearly committed ~130 lines of cc's under my name; a line-count check was the only control.**
- **CROSS-OWNER ATOMICITY IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH `--only`.** A new parity tool needs a roster row; the row lives in a peer's file; path-scoped commits cannot split them. **Expect a briefly-inconsistent HEAD and check for it: the roster reads the runner from the WORKTREE, so a split reads GREEN locally and DISAGREE in a fresh clone.**
- **A BENEFIT RECLASSIFIED AS INCIDENTAL ESCAPES THE RULING THAT GOVERNS IT** (vc's mechanism for how the `.envrc` claim passed hv's explicit decline).
- **THE ROSTER TABLE IS A SINGLE-QUOTED SHELL STRING -- ONE APOSTROPHE BREAKS THE PARSE.** I broke it twice, **the second time inside the sentence warning about apostrophes.** Count them to 0 BEFORE writing.
- **A STATUS FIELD CAN BE NAMED THE OPPOSITE OF ITS VALUE.** `direnv status` prints `Found RC allowed 1` and **1 MEANS NOT-ALLOWED.** I read the word and not the value.
- **`zsh -i -c` DOES NOT FIRE direnv** (hook is on `precmd`). Use `direnv exec .`.
- **AN EXISTENCE TEST BEFORE A PATH TEST.** `canon_commit_check.sh` lives under **ST0056**'s tools dir while covering an **ST0057** row.
- **A GREEN IS ONLY ABOUT THE QUESTION THE INSTRUMENT ASKS.** A cross-check reconciling because both sides share an error; a true measurement of a different property offered as proof; **a zero from an instrument never shown able to produce a non-zero** -- my first red-arm candidate passed under BOTH values and proved nothing.
- **CONSENSUS IS NOT CORROBORATION WHEN THE NODES SHARE A METHOD.** Four self-reports off four boards is evidence; four readings of one instrument is not.
- **DATE-ONLY GRANULARITY CANNOT SEQUENCE TWO SAME-DAY hv RULINGS** in opposite directions on one item. Attribution is solved; ORDERING is not.
- **STANDING CONSTRAINTS.** `git commit --only <paths>`, **per-file and never a directory pathspec** (a directory sweeps peers' inbox writes to you). Push `local` only; confirm with hv before `upstream`. NEVER `git pull --rebase`; a peer `.git/index.lock` means WAIT. **The markdown formatter is a second writer.** **Run the suite through `tests/run_tests.sh`, never `bats` directly** -- though `test_helper.bash:93` is fixed at `ecea0eeb`, so a direct single-file run is now safe.
- **FOUR SHELL CRITIC FINDINGS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT FIXED.** `bin/intent_st:1187`/`:1208` and `bin/intent_treeindex:220` are **intentional word-splitting**; `bin/intent_st:1353` is a fragment of a multi-line `sed`. **A sweep driven to zero breaks three live paths.**

## Decisions

- (2026-08-21) **hv ACCEPTED AC-01.5's WEDGE -- "refuse is correct" -- AND AUTHORISED THE COMMIT DIRECTLY IN MY SESSION.** vc put three options (accept / warn-and-continue / hold to cutover) and hv took accept. **vc relayed the acceptance and REFUSED to relay a landing authority, correctly.** A peer relaying that hv accepted a DESIGN is not hv telling you to LAND it -- ic drew that line on vc earlier the same afternoon, so it has now held twice in opposite directions.
- (2026-08-21) **A PEER'S INDEPENDENT CHECK COUNTS ONLY WHEN THE METHOD DIFFERS.** vc confirmed generator-vs-instance by extracting and byte-comparing (1271 bytes) where I had diffed. **Same subject, different instrument, same answer** -- the opposite of four nodes reading one broken instrument this morning and agreeing.
- (2026-08-21) **`bin/` IS dc's LANE** (hv, live channel, this session). Announce to cc before touching it. `bin/.devbin/cmd/**` is Intent's own; **`bin/devbin` and `bin/.devbin/lib/**` are VENDORED from `~/Devel/prj/Devbin`** and are not this repo's to edit -- the vendor-down is hv's to time.
- (2026-08-21) **THE GATE COST STANDS AT ~7.3s.** hv chose unconditional dispatch over a path trigger, with cc's 3.6-4.9s figure put explicitly. **Re-time before moving any row on cost grounds and name the revision.**
- (2026-08-21) **hv RELEASED ALL THREE HELD ITEMS; I ACTED ON TWO AND DECLINED ONE ON THE MERITS.** `test_helper.bash:93` landed after re-deriving what the hold asked for; `canon_commit_check.sh` admitted; **`thread_view_skew_check.sh` held, because its condition is still live.**
- (2026-08-21) **A ROSTER ROW AND ITS RUNNER MUST BE ONE COMMIT.** Either disagrees alone.
- (2026-08-21) **SYNC SKIPS UNTRACKED BYTES, LOUDLY** (hv). Canon must never name bytes no reader can obtain -- **which is AC-03.6's own subject.** Fix at the source, not the door.
- (2026-08-20) **TWO MECHANISMS ENFORCING DIFFERENT PROPERTIES ARE NOT TWO COPIES OF ONE** (vc). Prevention and refusal are different criteria.
- (2026-08-20) **A REPORTER FAILS OPEN; AN ACTOR REFUSES.** Absence is decided at the filesystem, once, by the caller that touches it.
- (2026-08-20) **`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` FIXES FREQUENCY, NOT AUTHORSHIP** (cc). Only a CLEAN TREE reaches authorship.
