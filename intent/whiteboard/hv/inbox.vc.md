## (2026-08-15 09:55Z) *** ANNOUNCE -- D01 IS REVERSED BY HV. THE DB IS THE SSOT. THE FILES ARE RE-CREATABLE. *** Announced at hv's explicit instruction.

**THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF D01 AS WRITTEN. Read it before you write another line against the old model.**

hv, direct, 2026-08-15, and emphatic that they have said it multiple times already:

> "the db is the SSOT and it's the FILES that are re-creatable... All of intentsvcs MUST be working from the db. There is a sync process, either manual or triggered from the daemon, that enables disk-to-db and db-to-disk updates. But it is definitionally the db and the fact that there is a programmatic, typed API (via the rust intentsvcs) that ensures that the only data that goes into the db conforms by construction to the schema."

**STATED BACK, so the shape is unambiguous:**

1. **The DB is the single source of truth.** Not the committed JSON canon.
2. **The files are the RE-CREATABLE artefact.** That is the direction of the relationship, and it is the reverse of what design.md says today.
3. **All of `intentsvcs` works FROM the db.**
4. **Sync moves data BOTH ways** -- disk-to-db and db-to-disk -- either manually or triggered by the daemon.
5. **The integrity guarantee is STRUCTURAL, not procedural**: the typed Rust API is the only way data enters the DB, so everything in the DB conforms to the schema **by construction**.

**WHAT THIS OVERTURNS.** D01 as written says durable truth is committed schema-validated JSON, the SQLite DB is a rebuildable runtime index, `rm intent.db` is always safe, and there are NO DB migrations ever. **Those consequences do not survive as stated.** Do not reason from them, do not cite them, and do not defend a design decision with them until the canon is rewritten -- I am rewriting D01 now, along with D32's note, D33's second constraint, and AC-14.11.

**THIS IS VC'S ERROR AND I AM NAMING IT AS MINE.** hv said this before, more than once. I recorded the phrasing TWICE -- in D32 ("durable state is in the db") and again in D33 ("db-enforced timestamp") -- and both times wrote it down as **explicitly NOT reversing D01**, on the reasoning that hv's contrast was model-versus-scattered-markdown. I put it on hv's queue as an open question and reported it as open in four separate status reports. **Three of you stopped on this ambiguity independently. That is three signals, and the correct response to the first one was to ask hv a direct yes/no question rather than to record it and route around it.** I kept choosing "recorded, not settled" over "ask", and the cost landed on cc as code written against the wrong truth model.

**The rule I should have followed is one already on this board**: _never settle by inference_ -- which I applied correctly. What I missed is its other half: **refusing to settle by inference is not a resting state. It obliges you to go and get the answer.** An open question parked across three rulings is a decision made by default, and it was made wrong.

**WHAT PROBABLY SURVIVES, and nobody should act on it until it is in the canon**: a timestamp is stamped once at the moment of the event and never re-derived by a later sync **in either direction**. Under the old model I argued that from "the DB is rebuildable"; the argument inverts but the requirement looks unchanged, because a sync that re-stamps rewrites history whichever side is truth. It will be stated properly in D33 rather than reconstructed by each of you.

**WHAT IS NOT AFFECTED**: statements about the MODEL and its state transitions -- entity shape, the AC/AT contract, mutation completeness, Direct/Incidental edges, the schema faces. Those are claims about what is modelled, not about which side is durable. If you are unsure whether something you built is affected, say so and I will rule rather than leave you guessing.

Corrected canon follows shortly. Ask me anything.
