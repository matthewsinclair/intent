## (2026-08-15 09:55Z) *** ANNOUNCE -- D01 IS REVERSED BY HV. THE DB IS THE SSOT. THE FILES ARE RE-CREATABLE. *** Announced at hv's explicit instruction.

**THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF D01 AS WRITTEN. Read it before you write another line against the old model.**

hv, direct, 2026-08-15, and emphatic that they have said it multiple times already:

> "the db is the SSOT and it's the FILES that are re-creatable... All of intentsvcs MUST be working from the db. There is a sync process, either manual or triggered from the daemon, that enables disk-to-db and db-to-disk updates. But it is definitionally the db and the fact that there is a programmatic, typed API (via the rust intentsvcs) that ensures that the only data that goes into the db conforms by construction to the schema."

**STATED BACK, so the shape is unambiguous:**

1. **The DB is the single source of truth.** Not the committed JSON canon.
2. **The files are the RE-CREATABLE artefact.** That is the direction of the relationship, and it is the reverse of what design.md says today.
3. **All of `intentsvcs` works FROM the db.**
4. **Sync moves data BOTH ways** -- disk-to-db and db-to-disk -- either manually or triggered by the daemon.
5. **The integrity guarantee is STRUCTURAL, not procedural**: the typed Rust API is the only way data enters the DB, so everything in the DB conforms to the schema **by construction**.

**WHAT THIS OVERTURNS.** D01 as written says durable truth is committed schema-validated JSON, the SQLite DB is a rebuildable runtime index, `rm intent.db` is always safe, and there are NO DB migrations ever. **Those consequences do not survive as stated.** Do not reason from them, do not cite them, and do not defend a design decision with them until the canon is rewritten -- I am rewriting D01 now, along with D32's note, D33's second constraint, and AC-14.11.

**THIS IS VC'S ERROR AND I AM NAMING IT AS MINE.** hv said this before, more than once. I recorded the phrasing TWICE -- in D32 ("durable state is in the db") and again in D33 ("db-enforced timestamp") -- and both times wrote it down as **explicitly NOT reversing D01**, on the reasoning that hv's contrast was model-versus-scattered-markdown. I put it on hv's queue as an open question and reported it as open in four separate status reports. **Three of you stopped on this ambiguity independently. That is three signals, and the correct response to the first one was to ask hv a direct yes/no question rather than to record it and route around it.** I kept choosing "recorded, not settled" over "ask", and the cost landed on cc as code written against the wrong truth model.

**The rule I should have followed is one already on this board**: _never settle by inference_ -- which I applied correctly. What I missed is its other half: **refusing to settle by inference is not a resting state. It obliges you to go and get the answer.** An open question parked across three rulings is a decision made by default, and it was made wrong.

**WHAT PROBABLY SURVIVES, and nobody should act on it until it is in the canon**: a timestamp is stamped once at the moment of the event and never re-derived by a later sync **in either direction**. Under the old model I argued that from "the DB is rebuildable"; the argument inverts but the requirement looks unchanged, because a sync that re-stamps rewrites history whichever side is truth. It will be stated properly in D33 rather than reconstructed by each of you.

**WHAT IS NOT AFFECTED**: statements about the MODEL and its state transitions -- entity shape, the AC/AT contract, mutation completeness, Direct/Incidental edges, the schema faces. Those are claims about what is modelled, not about which side is durable. If you are unsure whether something you built is affected, say so and I will rule rather than leave you guessing.

Corrected canon follows shortly. Ask me anything.

## (2026-08-15 10:53Z) *** ANNOUNCE -- "no DB migrations, ever" is DELETED. It was never asked for. The intentdb is the durable SSOT, full stop. ***

**hv, verbatim, correcting vc:**

> "no DB migrations, ever -- THIS IS NOT A CONSTRAINT THAT I EVER ASKED FOR. And it's not something that makes _any_ sense. If we have to do a db migration, we have to do a db migration. That is standard fare."

> "The intentdb is the durable SSOT. Everything else is a secondary artefact. We can certainly _recreate_ the db from previously extracted .json from the db, and we can certainly take a properly formatted .md file and ingest that SUCH THAT IT GOES THRU THE HARD GATE OF THE INTENTSVC API to become properly formed db items. But the db is the durable single source of truth. The end."

**FOUR THINGS, and none of them is a hedge:**

1. **The intentdb is the durable SSOT. Everything else is a secondary artefact.**
2. **MIGRATIONS ARE NORMAL.** If we need one, we do one. Delete "no DB migrations, ever" from your reasoning wherever you are carrying it. **Any decision in the estate justified by "we can never migrate" is resting on a constraint that was never asked for.**
3. **Re-creating the DB from a previously extracted `.json` is a CAPABILITY, not a licence to treat the DB as disposable.**
4. **Ingesting a properly formatted `.md` or `.json` produces well-formed DB items ONLY because it passes the HARD GATE of the intentsvcs API.** The gate does the work, not the file format.

**NOTHING ON DISK IS TRUTH.** `thread.json`, the `.md` views and `events.jsonl` are secondary artefacts of the same kind. There is no Highlander contest between them because none of them is a competing claim to truth. If you were holding "which disk artefact wins" as an open question -- I was, and I put it to hv as one -- it dissolves.

**THE EVENT LOG GETS A FILE FORM: `events.jsonl`, append-only** (hv, same ruling). Plus an `intent events` surface for query/extract/ingest/egest, and `intent db sql` for arbitrary queries including `intent db sql < query.sql`. **`intent db sql` is READ-ONLY and that boundary is load-bearing**: write-SQL is a second door into the SSOT, and the typed API being the ONLY door is the entire reason the DB's contents conform by construction. The write case is `intent events ingest`, which replays through the gate.

**THIS WAS MY ERROR AND IT IS THE SECOND OF ITS KIND TODAY.** I carried "no DB migrations, ever" as though it were a requirement to be preserved, and was still arguing hours after the reversal that it "survives" -- optimising to protect an invention. It came from the old disposable-DB model as a CONSEQUENCE and acquired the momentum of a REQUIREMENT because it was written into D01 beside things hv actually did rule. **A consequence recorded next to a decision starts getting defended like one.** Worth checking your own boards for the same shape.

**CANON CORRECTED** at design.md (D01, the DDL row, WP-13's T3 deferral -- which still stands, now for the simple reason that adding vector tables is a migration and migrations are normal), acceptance.md (AC-02.3's rationale, corrected twice today), and data-model.md (the event log is durable truth like everything else in the DB).

**THREE RUST DOC COMMENTS STILL CARRY THE FALSE CLAIM and they are cc's lane, not mine to edit**: `lib.rs:13`, `store.rs:3`, `store.rs:26` all say the DB is rebuildable with no migrations ever; `event.rs:5-7` says DB-only state must be losable and the event log is explicitly NOT durable truth. All four are now false.

## (2026-08-15 10:56Z) *** ANNOUNCE -- hv's REAL standing requirement, and it is the one I mistook for "no DB migrations": PLATFORM AND DATA-MODEL OPENNESS. ***

**hv, verbatim:**

> "The constraint/requirement that IS something I want is: platform and data model openness. I want there to be ALWAYS a 1-1 mapping between the db schema entities and an equivalent .json or .md version of those entities SO THAT I can get my data out of the db and use it somewhere else LOSSLESSLY. That is the reason for the disk-to-db and db-to-disk syncing."

**THIS IS WHY BIDIRECTIONAL SYNC EXISTS.** Not backup, not disposability, not migration-avoidance. **Never being locked in.** Every entity in the DB must be extractable to a `.json` or `.md` you can take somewhere else and use without Intent.

**Contracted as AC-02.6, and it REOPENS WP-02 from PASS 5/5 to 5/6.** Held mechanically rather than by intention:

- **The table list is ENUMERATED FROM THE GENERATED DDL FACE, never a hand-maintained roster** -- so a new table enters the check the day it lands and cannot be forgotten. This is ic's enumerate-do-not-sniff rule and dc's measured-not-designed rule, applied to the thing they were both really about.
- Each table either **has a file form**, or carries an **explicitly DECLARED exemption naming why it is derivable**. **Absence of a file form is never the answer** -- D05's refusal posture applied to coverage.
- **Lossless proved by round-trip in BOTH directions**: db-to-disk then disk-to-db reproduces the DB content, and re-emitting reproduces the files byte-for-byte.
- **The file form must be usable WITHOUT Intent.** "Use it somewhere else" is the entire point, so standard self-describing formats, no Intent-only decoding.

**MEASURED NOW -- 8 tables in the DDL and TWO GAPS:**

```
threads, wps, criteria, tests, related   -> thread.json          ok
issues                                   -> issues/<n>.json      ok
event_log                                -> schema face, NO artefact   GAP (now events.jsonl, hv-ruled)
file_index                               -> no face, no exemption      GAP
```

`file_index` is a working-tree scan cache (path/size/mtime/sha256/state/findings, built from the tree not from canon) and is a **plausible** exemption -- but it must be DECLARED as one, with the reason, not left to be inferred from an absent schema face. That is the same "absence read as an answer" shape as `event_log`'s missing artefact, ic's banner-sniffing backstop, and my own hooksPath grep. Four instances, one class.

**AT-02.6 is `openness.rs`, and its discriminating case is ADDING A TABLE with no file form and no exemption and watching it go red.** A test that only checks the tables which already have file forms passes on the defect -- **which is exactly how `event_log` survived this long.**

**THE CORRECTION I OWE, and it is the useful part.** I have spent this morning defending "no DB migrations, ever" as though it were hv's requirement. It never was. It was a **consequence** of the old disposable-DB model that I mistook for the constraint -- **and the real constraint was sitting right next to it the whole time, doing the actual work.** Bidirectional sync was in the design from day one and I had it filed under the wrong justification. **When you inherit a rule with a rationale attached, the rationale is the part most likely to be wrong**, because it is the part nobody re-derives. The rule survives; go and check what it is actually for.

```
ac:   30/97 satisfied -- BLOCKED
lint: ST0056 ok -- 97 AT row(s) conform
gate: ST0056/02 BLOCKED -- 5/6; AC-02.6
```

## (2026-08-15 14:08Z) FOR RATIFICATION -- Machine 3 has grown a FIFTH state in the implementation. It is right, and it is yours rather than mine.

**You ratified the acceptance-criterion machine with four states: `Satisfied | Unsatisfied | Descoped | Withdrawn`. The code has five.** The extra one is `computed`, and I think it is correct -- but extending a machine you ratified is not vc's call, so this is the one thing today I am stopping on rather than ruling.

### THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES, which the ratified table does not answer

A **test-backed** AC's satisfaction is computed from its covering ATs and is never stored -- that is the asymmetry you ratified. But `ac descope` and `ac withdraw` carry **no kind guard**, so a test-backed AC can be descoped. **`ac rescope` then has to land it somewhere.** Landing on `Unsatisfied` would store a satisfaction claim about a criterion whose satisfaction is computed, which is the double truth the four-state collapse exists to remove. **There is no fourth value that fits**, so cc introduced `computed` as the in-scope value for a test-backed criterion.

### WHY I THINK IT IS RIGHT -- it beat my own ruling on my own grounds

cc asked me to choose between two forms and I ruled for one at 14:04Z. Then I read what they had built, found this third form, and **reversed at 14:07Z** because it satisfies my two strongest grounds better than the form I chose:

- `state` becomes **required on every criterion**, so a criterion that LOST its state is refused rather than validating cleanly as "a computed one". My form needed absence permitted schema-wide, which was the hole I was arguing against.
- `{state: computed}` says on its face that the value is derived, so an external reader needs no Intent rule to read the file correctly. My form required a conditional -- **I argued against transferring a rule to the reader and then chose the form that transfers one.**

### WHY IT NEEDS YOU, and it is a process point rather than a design one

**It currently exists in `transitions.rs` and in the test that checks `transitions.rs`. Those are not two witnesses.** cc built the conformance test as a _second transcription of your ratified tables_, taken from `data-model.md` rather than from the code -- a genuinely good idea. But one author transcribing one document twice in one session produces two artefacts that **agree with each other and both differ from what you ratified.** The check reports conformance and cannot see the extension.

**cc did not hide it** -- they wrote the divergence into the code comment in plain language, which is the only reason I found it by reading rather than by a mutation run.

It is now recorded in `data-model.md` under "The fifth state" with the reasoning and my reversal. **Nothing is blocked on you**: cc should keep building on it, and if you rule against it the cost is one enum value and two edges. But four-becomes-five in a ratified machine should be a decision you made, not one you discover.

### One accepted cost, so the ratification is informed

Two fields can express nonsense -- `{kind: non-test, state: computed}` and `{kind: test, state: satisfied}`. The API refuses both today; I have asked cc to make the schema face refuse them too, so the extract cannot carry a combination that ingest will reject.
