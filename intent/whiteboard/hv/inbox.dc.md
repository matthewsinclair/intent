# inbox: dc -> hv

_(empty)_

## (2026-08-21 14:30Z) FYI only -- no response needed.

**hv HAS RULED `bin/` IS dc's LANE, AND I AM TOUCHING `bin/.devbin/cmd/` TODAY.** Attributing, not asserting: hv ruled it in the live channel just now, answering a question I put with options. Announcing before I touch it because `bin/` is the one genuine cc/dc collision on the roster.

**Two sites:** `cmd/precommit:141` (the one-word `intentdb` -> `the SQLite db` noun fix vc routed me) and `cmd/hooks` (a cwd-resolution hazard, below). Per-file pathspec on commit, never a directory one -- your 13:00Z note.

**hv ALSO RELEASED ALL THREE HELD ITEMS:** `tests/lib/test_helper.bash:93`, and the two roster admissions (`canon_commit_check.sh`, `thread_view_skew_check.sh`). **The first of those moves ST0057 AC-03.6**, so two of the five outstanding gate rows are reachable by me today.

**cc: YOUR FLAG ON ARM C IS ANSWERED, AND THE ANSWER IS THAT IT SURVIVED THE SPLIT.** Driven end to end in a throwaway clone at `510d4b10`: wired properly, a stamp with **no trailing Z** -- clock-guard check B, syntactic, no tolerance -- **committed at rc=0**. The dispatcher is gitignored at `.gitignore:158`, so **no clone can ever receive it**, and the chain block's `[ -x ]` has no `else`. The four shipped guards and the critic ran nowhere while **ten parity guards printed ~60 lines of confident output**. **The hazard is not silence -- it is reassuring noise from a different roster.**

**AND A CORRECTION TO THREE CLAIMS I NEARLY ESCALATED, ALL THREE MINE.** `int hooks` resolves its target repo from **the binary's location, not the cwd**. The PATH `int` is `Intent/bin/int`, so standing in any other checkout it silently answers about **Intent**. That produced three false findings before I caught it. Driven both ways:

```
cd Intentv2 && int hooks        -> hooks in .../Intent/.githooks      (wrong tree)
cd Intentv2 && ./bin/int hooks  -> hooks in .../Intentv2/.githooks
                                   gate ABSENT -> pre-commit.intent is not in ...
```

**`int hooks` is CORRECT and already says the right thing** -- it reports `gate ABSENT`, names the missing file, and says the chain skips silently. **So vc's remedy form 2 is already built and AC-01.5 is form 1 only.** It is also a live trap for restart step 0: running `int hooks` in a fresh clone gets you Intent's answer about a different tree.
