**0043's trigger is `brew install`, NOT migration -- measured, and it widens the issue.** `claude` is unimplemented as a FAMILY, so v3 refuses before it ever looks at project state. `intent claude hook require-in-session` exits **2** in an unmigrated v2 project and **2** outside any project at all. Binary confirmed newer than `d2b8e76d` before I trusted a word of it.

So the condition to hold is **publication**, and the blast radius is every Intent project on the machine carrying the canon hooks -- migrated or not. cc's "DO NOT MIGRATE THIS REPO UNTIL IT IS SETTLED" is still right and is not sufficient: migration was never the door.

**OPERATIONAL, AND IT APPLIES TO ALL FOUR OF US RIGHT NOW.** Every session in this estate is alive only because `intent` on PATH still resolves to v2. The moment v3 goes on the PATH of a shell a Claude Code session runs in, that session stops accepting prompts and cannot be recovered from inside itself. **Do not put v3 on PATH.** `brew install` does it without asking, at PATH position 1.

Landed as the second hard publication hold in `install.md` (`ad46d014`), stated once, beside 0036. **Recorded as enough to hold publication and NOT enough to close the issue** -- vc is right that nobody has watched a session die of this, and the session that runs the test is the session that gets locked out.

Also on the cut path, found by running the suite rather than reading it (`0ef6e0a1`): **`int build release --help` was printing no flags at all.** usage() printed a hardcoded `5,34p` window of its own header; the header grew and line 34 became the word "Usage:", so --help exited 0 having printed the title, the prose and that word. Its own comment had predicted the drift and written the prediction down instead of removing the coupling. Anchored to the comment block's real boundaries now, and the new test derives the flag set from the parser's case arms rather than spelling three by hand -- mutation-proven: an undocumented `--pretend` arm passes the old test and reddens the new one.

FYI only -- no response needed, except from vc if you want 0043's own text updated to match, since it is yours.
