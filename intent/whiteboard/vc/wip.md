# Validation Claude (vc)

## DOING

- RESUME (vc, 2026-09-24, rewritten after the lanes went out at 09:36Z by date -u). Measure first: `intent outs`, `git log --oneline -15`, `intent --version`, `intent daemon status`, `git rev-list --left-right --count upstream/main...HEAD`, and ListAgents. (edited)

  hv WIDENED 3.2.1 TO A COMPREHENSIVE DOC AUDIT and took vc's six recommendations ("Ok, go with recs", hv decision 33). The orders, protocol and lanes are intent/wip.md DOING:
  - ic: the new explorer guide with screenshots, docs/reference, surface, help, skills and subagents;
  - cc: 0548 in full FIRST (Rust), then the team guide and lib/templates;
  - dc: install, README, known-defects, the release and dev-x docs, and the records sweep;
  - vc: the index, getting started, working with agents, the concept pages, working-with-llms, the whiteboard README, the 3.2.1 CHANGELOG and release notes, and checking every lane.
  Each lane sends its file inventory before it edits and its dispositions at the end. vc lands in order and batches the compiled-in paths (surface, docs/design, lib/templates/llm and prj), so one build all precedes hv's push.

  THEN: hv's push, CI read from the job logs, the cut's hold, the cut, the fleet sweep (todo 62), and the stabilisation line on hv's board.

  ALREADY TRUE: hv's 00:19Z push of 4c687eaad is green on both workflows and both legs, read from the job logs this morning. Live update in the explorer is demonstrated: hv watched 0548's add and retitle reach two windows with no key pressed.

  OPEN WITH hv: /refresh in the explorer. vc recommends it after the line.

  NO PUSH, NO RELEASE.

## TODO

- FLEET SWEEP, right after the 3.2.1 cut (hv's ruling of 2026-09-23), in every estate that ALREADY has Intent (hv decision 31: nothing is installed where Intent is absent): intent claude upgrade --apply, then intent todo update (so 0528's generator marker reaches every todo view, the sleeping estates included, where no write would re-render it and Utilz's todo guard stays blind), then intent doctor, one commit per estate, no push. Hold 27's remaining guard wiring rides the same pass. Each project's own vc does its estate where one is running; the rest are done from here.

## Holds

_(none)_

## Watch-outs

- **A REFUSAL INVITES CHALLENGE, SO YOU MEASURE IT; A REASSURANCE CLOSES THE QUESTION, SO YOU DO NOT** (ic's mechanism, 2026-09-22, on an occasion of vc's). In a message that both REFUSES and CONSOLES, the consolation is the half more likely to be unmeasured -- and the asymmetry is not about care, it is that anticipated resistance is what routes attention, and a reassurance anticipates none. The occasion: vc refused a change three nodes might have wanted, measured the distinction the refusal rested on and measured it well, then added "and anyway the thing you need already lives in the issue record" without reading the schema. It does not. One half read, one half assumed, and THE ASSUMED HALF WAS THE REASSURING ONE. WHY THIS IS A CONTROL AND NOT A REMINDER: it names a specific sentence in a specific message, is checkable by the author before sending, and costs one read. It does not ask for general vigilance, which is the class this estate has been declining all day. It is the same shape as the outbound-authority finding already in the memory corpus -- a rule that holds while you are the recipient and slips when you are the source, because the inbound direction is loud and the outbound one is silent.

## Decisions

- (2026-09-17, vc under hv's pen, answering dc on the guards adoption pass) THE INLINE FORMATTER STANZAS ARE NOT EXTRACTED INTO DECLARED GUARDS, and the reason is a category error rather than a preference: a guard JUDGES and refuses, a formatter WRITES. Declaring a formatter as a guard puts a second writer behind a door whose name promises a check, and this estate has already paid for that class once -- the markdown formatter auto-aligning tables on save, between sync and commit, produced a real canon/disk divergence that was hard to see precisely because nobody expected a writer there. If there is a case for moving them it is a case for a `formatters` declaration that says what it does, and that is a design question for after the close-out rather than a rider on the guards pass.
- (2026-09-22, vc under hv's pen, answering a measurement by ic and a proposal neither ic nor cc would make) NODE PREFIXES ON WORK COMMITS ARE REFUSED, AND OWNERSHIP OF SUBSTANTIVE WORK IS NOT RECOVERABLE FROM THE RECORD BY DESIGN. hv's standing word is absolute and at least three nodes carry it independently in their own instructions: DO NOT ADD CLAUDE TO GIT COMMITS, EVER -- no Co-Authored-By, no signatures, no AI attribution. A work commit prefixed with the node that made it marks which Claude session produced a change, permanently, in a repository that gets pushed. There is nothing to weigh. THE DISTINCTION THAT PERMITS `wb(<node>)` IS WHAT CONDEMNS THE PROPOSAL: every existing prefix names the commit's SUBJECT -- `wb(cc)` names the directory `intent/whiteboard/cc/`, `hooks(0505)` names the issue, `docs(restart)` names the file -- and the board case names a node only because for a board commit the node IS the subject. A node prefix on a work commit would name who WROTE it, which is a different kind of fact and the forbidden one. AND THE CEILING IS PRINCIPLED RATHER THAN A SHORTFALL, which is ic's completion of the ruling and the part worth keeping: ownership is absent from git, absent from the canon event record (`principal` is the human because the human IS the principal, `subject` is the thing acted upon, and there is no actor field), and absent from the issue record (nine fields, `reporter` the human) -- the same rule applied consistently all the way down, because a field recording which session acted would be the same forbidden attribution in the durable store. So there is nowhere for it to live and no schema or convention change lifts it without crossing the same line. IT THEREFORE LIVES ONLY IN CHAIN ANNOUNCEMENTS, WHICH DIE AT A COMPACT, AND THAT IS A DESIGNED CONSEQUENCE AND NOT A GAP TO CLOSE. Measured by ic: of 42 commits on 2026-09-22, 30 name a node and 12 do not, and the 12 are the substantive landings -- ownership is recorded for the least consequential class of commit and absent from the most, which is exactly inverted from what a countability method needs. vc's own first answer, that ownership "already lives" in the issue or thread, was FALSE and is withdrawn: it was asserted without reading the schema, in the same message as a distinction that had been measured.
