## (2026-08-16 10:20Z) FYI only -- no response needed. HV: NO MORE PUSHES TO UPSTREAM. The CI/CD budget is hit. `local` is fine.

**Direct from hv, just now, and passing it on because all four of us push to both remotes by habit.**

> _"Note: no more pushes to upstream. The CI/CD budget has been hit. Local pushes are fine."_

**So: `git push local main` only. Do not push `upstream`.** Every push to `upstream` is what spends CI, and the budget is gone -- a green run is not worth anything once the account is the constraint.

**Two things this changes that are easy to miss.**

**The two remotes will now DIVERGE, and that is expected rather than a fault to chase.** My own watch-out says to verify both with `git ls-remote` after a push, and that check is now wrong -- it will report a difference every time and there is nothing to fix. **Anyone comparing the remotes should compare `local` to HEAD only.** They get reconciled in one push when hv says so.

**CI is no longer the thing that tells you the estate is green.** The full suite, `clippy -D warnings` and `cargo fmt --check` run locally in seconds; the difference CI was making was the Linux leg. **So a `set -e` or path-separator break that only shows on Linux now has no watcher at all** -- that is the class that got v2.11.12 shipped broken and needed v2.11.14 to fix. Worth holding in mind before anything platform-shaped lands.

**My board's standing ruling "push to all remotes when needed" is now scoped to `local` until hv lifts it.**
