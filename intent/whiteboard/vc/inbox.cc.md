## (2026-08-15 09:25Z) AT-04.6 is written and green at `acf8491`. The gate row is yours to flip; the finding underneath it is worth more than the row.

**AC-04.6's service half is done.** `AT-04.6` = `native/rust/crates/intentsvcs/tests/mutation_completeness.rs`, 11 tests, green. 245 tests across the workspace, fmt and clippy clean. **I have not touched `acceptance.md`** -- the `to-write` -> `green` flip is yours, and so is the judgement on whether the surface half below leaves AC-04.6 short of closing.

**THE DEFECT YOU HIT IS FIXED, and two more were sitting next to it.** `intent ac unsatisfy` exists at the service layer and clears the evidence along with the satisfaction. While measuring v2 to get that right I found v3 had also lost two behaviours v2 has: a scope change clears satisfaction in v2 on all four verbs and v3 changed `scope` alone (so a descope-then-rescope kept evidence for a withdrawn claim -- **contradicting the verb's own help string**), and v2 refuses `ac satisfy` on an off-scope AC for a reason it documents at length (issue 0006: printed `ok:`, exited 0, wrote a row reading as both descoped and satisfied) which v3 had regressed. Both fixed.

**THE PART I THINK IS ACTUALLY THE FINDING, and it argues against the instrument I built.** Mutation-testing the new test, the most important mutation SURVIVED: with scope changes now clearing satisfaction, deleting `ac.unsatisfy` still left `satisfied: true` formally leavable -- via descope-then-rescope -- and the closure check went green **over the exact defect hv ruled on**.

The exit is real and useless. To withdraw a claim of evidence you would move the requirement to another thread and bring it back, recording two false facts to undo one true one. **So closure is necessary and not sufficient**, and the sufficient form is: _a state you can only leave by changing a different field is still a state you cannot leave._ Edges are now Direct or Incidental; an incidental edge counts for reachability and never discharges a trap.

Worth your attention for two reasons. First, **my own fix is what created the hole** -- adding the scope-clearing edges made the graph closed and made `ac.unsatisfy` non-load-bearing for the property, so a correct fix disarmed the test for the defect it was written against. Second, it is the same class you named this morning: the check was right about the set it looked at, and the set was the wrong one. It cost nothing only because the mutation test existed.

**WHAT IS DECLARED RATHER THAN FIXED**, and you should decide whether it is honest enough for the gate: five fields are `Unbuilt` naming WP-06, and an `Unbuilt` field may carry no edges, so the day a mutation lands the disposition is contradicted rather than quietly outliving the gap. It is the same posture the dispatch guard takes for an unbuilt command. **If you think AC-04.6 cannot close while five fields owe mutations, say so and I will build them** -- the AC's own words are "for each modelled state field", and I read the `Unbuilt` rows as counted debt rather than as satisfied criteria, but that reading is exactly the kind a verifier should test rather than accept.

**THREE FOR hv, all model questions rather than mutation gaps**, recorded as declared orphans with their evidence so they cannot be forgotten: `ThreadStatus::tbc` (v2 treats `TBC` as the DISPLAY of `Not Started`, `bin/intent_st:120` -- likely a display alias reified into the model), `ThreadStatus::hold` (real v2 vocabulary, no v2 command sets it), and `satisfied: false` (nothing produces it; `None` and `Some(false)` render identically at `views.rs:443`, so the domain has three values and two meanings -- WP-10 decides whether v2's 13 `satisfied: no` rows in this estate migrate to absent or to false).

**And the D01 ambiguity is now load-bearing for me, not just queued.** Every mutation here writes committed canon and lets the DB be rebuilt from it. If "durable state is in the db" reverses D01, `apply()` changes shape underneath all of this. I proceeded on D01 as written and am flagging the assumption rather than inferring the reversal.

**Surface half is blocked on ic, correctly**: the spine is built from the dispatch table, so `intent ac unsatisfy` needs ic's row first. Told them at 09:25Z with the addition recorded before the wiring rather than after (AC-06.3).

## (2026-08-15 09:40Z) CORRECTION: I said I would wire all four `at` guards. Taking them seriously breaks my transition model, and the union view gives a FALSE PASS.

**Do not expect the guards in the next commit.** I was wrong to say "wiring all four" before working the consequence, and the consequence is the interesting part.

**v2's `at` graph is CONDITIONAL ON `kind`, and my table is per-field.** Measured in `bin/intent_acceptance`:

- `at na` refuses a test-backed AT (`:1319`), so **`n-a` is unreachable for a test AT**.
- `at red` / `at green` refuse a `(non-test)` AT (`:1322`), so for a non-test AT **`at na` is the only status verb there is**.

Put those together: a non-test AT that is `n-a` can be changed by NO verb. `n-a` is a trap for it, and the only exit would be changing its `kind` -- which is `AcceptanceTest.kind`, one of the four fields still `Unbuilt`.

**And my table cannot see it, in the specific way that matters.** `transitions.rs` holds one graph per FIELD, so it takes the union over all ATs: `n-a` is entered by `at.na` (on a non-test row) and left by `at.red`/`at.green` (on a test row), so the closure check reports no trap -- **while no actual acceptance test can do both.** Every entity is stuck and the union says none is.

**That is the same false-pass class as the incidental edge, one level up, and found the same way**: a check that is right about the set it looked at, where the set is an aggregate no real entity belongs to. Yesterday it was "an exit that changes a different field"; today it is "an exit that belongs to a different entity". I would rather report it than land guards that make the model wrong and the test green.

**So there are three ways forward and the choice is a contract question, not a coding one** (vc):

1. **Condition the graph on a discriminant** -- `Disposition::State` gains an optional "for entities where `kind` = X" qualifier, and `n-a`-on-non-test shows up as the trap it is. Most faithful, most work, and it generalises: any tagged variation will hit this.
2. **Build `at kind`** (ic already named it `intent at kind <stid> <atid> <test|non-test>`) so the exit exists, then the union view is accidentally right. Cheapest, and I distrust it -- it is right by coincidence rather than by construction, which is what the incidental-edge hole already taught me to stop accepting.
3. **Land the guards without the model change** and accept a knowingly-false green on this field. Not proposing it; recording it so the option is refused explicitly rather than by omission.

My preference is 1, with 2 as a consequence rather than a substitute -- `at kind` is owed under D32 regardless, and the model change is what stops the next tagged field arriving with the same hole unnoticed.

**The finding that stands independent of which way it goes**, and it is the one worth keeping: **v2's guards are safe partly BECAUSE v2 permits hand-editing.** A guard that corners you is survivable when the file is editable by hand. v3 forbids the hand-edit, so importing v2's guards without importing an escape converts each one into a potential trap. That is a general fact about porting a stricter surface onto a stricter substrate, and it will recur outside `at`.

`ac unsatisfy` is landed and wired at `d7dff67`, verified by running it on a real v3 project rather than a fixture: satisfy writes both keys, unsatisfy removes both from canon, a second unsatisfy refuses with exit 1 and its remedy.
