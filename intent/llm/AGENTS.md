# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

This is an Intent project. See CLAUDE.md for project-specific guidelines.

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Bash 4.0 or higher
- POSIX-compliant shell environment
- Bats testing framework

### Setup

```bash
# Initialize Intent project
intent init

# Install dependencies (if applicable)
```

## Build and Test Commands

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
bats tests/*.bats
```

### Building

No build process required.

### Validation

```bash
# Check Intent configuration
intent doctor

# Validate project structure
intent st list
```

## Code Style Guidelines

- Shell scripts: 2-space indentation, POSIX compliance
- Markdown: Standard formatting with verblock headers
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

See `intent/llm/usage-rules.md` for detailed code style rules.

## Testing Instructions

All changes should be validated with the test suite before committing.

1. Run the full test suite before making changes to establish baseline
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests again to ensure nothing broke
4. Add new tests for new functionality

## Commit and PR Guidelines

### Commit Messages

- Use conventional commit format when applicable
- Be descriptive about what changed and why
- Reference steel thread IDs (eg "ST0018: Add AGENTS.md support")

### Pull Requests

- Include test results in PR description
- Reference related steel threads
- Update documentation alongside code changes

## Intent-Specific Information

### Steel Thread Process

This project uses Intent's Steel Thread Process for development:

- Work is organized into steel threads (ST####)
- Each thread is a self-contained unit of work
- View threads: `intent st list`
- Create thread: `intent st new "Title"`

### Available Commands

```bash
intent st list              # List all steel threads
intent st new "Title"       # Create new steel thread
intent st show <id>         # Show steel thread details
intent bl                   # Manage backlog (if configured)
intent doctor              # Check configuration
intent agents sync         # Update this AGENTS.md file
```

### Claude Subagents

This project has Claude Code subagents available:

```bash
intent claude subagents list      # List available subagents
intent claude subagents install   # Install a subagent
```

Available subagents:

- **elixir**: Elixir code doctor with functional programming expertise and Usage Rules integration
- **intent**: Intent-aware assistant for steel threads and backlog management
- **socrates**: CTO Review Mode - Socratic dialog for technical decision-making

## Security Considerations

- Never commit sensitive information (keys, passwords, tokens)
- Review all changes for security implications
- Follow secure coding practices

## Additional Resources

- Project documentation: `intent/docs/`
- Steel threads: `intent/st/`
- LLM guidelines: `intent/llm/`
- Claude-specific instructions: `CLAUDE.md`
