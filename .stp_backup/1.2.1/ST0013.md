# ST0013: STP Blog Post Series

- **Status**: In Progress
- **Created**: 2025-03-11
- **Completed**: 
- **Author**: Matthew Sinclair

## Summary

Create a series of blog posts about the Steel Thread Process (STP) to explain its purpose, philosophy, and implementation. The blog posts will highlight how STP improves software development, particularly when working with LLMs, and discuss the importance of capturing intent in the development process.

## Objectives

1. Explain the STP concept and its benefits to a wider audience
2. Demonstrate how STP enhances collaboration between developers and LLMs
3. Discuss the importance of capturing intent in software development
4. Provide practical examples of STP in action
5. Create a comprehensive yet concise overview of the STP methodology

## Blog Post Series Plan

### Post 0: Motivation for STP

- The current challenges in software development documentation
- Why existing approaches fall short
- The vision behind creating STP
- Setting the stage for the series

### Post 1: Introduction to STP

- Overview of what STP is and why it was created
- The problem STP solves in modern software development
- Core principles and philosophy behind STP
- Brief explanation of steel threads as a development approach
- Introduction to the upcoming post series

### Post 2: The Steel Thread Methodology

- Detailed explanation of what a steel thread is
- How steel threads differ from traditional development methods
- Benefits of the steel thread approach
- Examples of effective steel thread implementation
- Managing work using steel threads

### Post 3: Intent Capture in Software Development

- The challenge of capturing and preserving intent in development
- How STP addresses the intent capture problem
- The importance of intent when working with LLMs
- Structured documentation as a vehicle for intent
- Examples of intent documentation in STP

### Post 4: LLM Collaboration with STP

- How STP is specifically designed for LLM collaboration
- Context management strategies in STP
- Templates and structure that enhance LLM effectiveness
- The feedback loop between documentation and implementation
- Future opportunities for LLM integration in STP

### Post 5: Getting Started with STP

- Installation and setup instructions
- Basic commands and workflow
- Integrating STP into existing projects
- Common patterns and best practices
- Resources for further learning

### Post 6: Next Steps and Future Work

- Current state of STP and lessons learned
- Planned enhancements and feature roadmap
- Integration opportunities with other tools and systems
- Advanced LLM collaboration features
- Community contributions and long-term vision

## Implementation Plan

1. Draft each blog post in the series
2. Create diagrams and visuals to illustrate key concepts
3. Include code examples and practical demonstrations
4. Ensure consistent terminology and messaging across all posts
5. Optimize content for readability and accessibility

All blog posts will be stored in the `/stp/doc/blog` directory and will be formatted in Markdown.

## Success Criteria

- Complete series of 7 high-quality blog posts
- Clear explanation of STP concepts, especially intent capture
- Practical examples that demonstrate the value of STP
- Logical progression of topics across the series
- Content that is accessible to developers of various experience levels

## Notes

- Each post should be approximately 1000-1500 words
- Include diagrams where appropriate to illustrate concepts (text-based ASCII diagrams are preferred)
- The posts should balance theory and practical application
- Focus on the unique aspects of STP, particularly intent capture and LLM collaboration
- Document the process of writing these blog posts using STP/Backlog itself (meta-documentation)
