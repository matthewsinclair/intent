   How Intent v2.0.0's agent system transforms AI pair programming by giving Claude permanent understanding of your methodology.

## About This Series

This blog series was created using Intent itself (ST0013), demonstrating the methodology in action. The posts progress from conceptual understanding to practical implementation, suitable for developers, team leads, and anyone interested in improving their development process.

## Key Concepts

- **Steel Threads**: Complete, minimal paths through your system that capture intention
- **Intention-First Development**: Starting with "why" before "what"
- **LLM Collaboration**: Using structured documentation to enhance AI assistance
- **Two-Tier Tracking**: Strategic intent at thread level, tactical execution at task level
