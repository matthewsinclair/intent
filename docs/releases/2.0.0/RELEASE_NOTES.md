# Intent v2.0.0 Release Notes

## Release Date: July 17, 2025 (Updated: July 27, 2025)

## Overview

Intent v2.0.0 marks a major milestone in the evolution of the Steel Thread Process tooling. This release represents a complete rebrand from STP to Intent, reflecting the tool's core mission of capturing and preserving the intention behind software development decisions.

## Major Changes

### 🤖 Claude Code Sub-Agent Integration

Intent v2.0.0 includes full integration with Claude Code's sub-agent system, revolutionizing AI-assisted development:

- **Intent Agent**: Pre-built agent that understands steel threads, Intent commands, and project structure
- **Elixir Agent**: Specialized agent for Elixir development with Usage Rules and Ash/Phoenix patterns
- **Agent Management**: Complete suite of commands for installing, syncing, and managing agents
- **Seamless Integration**: Agents work automatically with Claude Code sessions

### 🚀 Complete Rebrand: STP → Intent

The project has been renamed from "STP" (Steel Thread Process) to "Intent" to better communicate its purpose. While the Steel Thread methodology remains unchanged, the tooling now has a name that immediately conveys its value proposition.

### 📁 Simplified Directory Structure

The project structure has been flattened and simplified:

**Before (STP v1.x):**
```
stp/
├── bin/        # Executables mixed with project
├── prj/        # Nested project directory
│   ├── st/     # Steel threads
│   └── wip.md  # Work in progress
├── eng/        # Engineering docs
└── usr/        # User docs
```

**After (Intent v2.0.0):**
```
.
├── agents/     # Claude Code sub-agents (global)
│   ├── intent/ # Intent methodology agent
│   └── elixir/ # Elixir code doctor agent
├── bin/        # Tool executables (top-level)
├── intent/     # Project artifacts (flattened)
│   ├── agents/ # Project-specific sub-agents
│   ├── st/     # Steel threads
│   ├── eng/    # Engineering docs
│   ├── usr/    # User docs
│   └── wip.md  # Work in progress
└── tests/      # Test suite
```

### 🔧 New Commands

- **`intent bootstrap`**: One-command global setup with clear instructions
- **`intent doctor`**: Comprehensive diagnostics to troubleshoot issues
- **`intent agents`**: Complete agent management system:
  - `intent agents list` - Show available and installed agents
  - `intent agents install` - Install agents to Claude configuration
  - `intent agents sync` - Update agents while preserving modifications
  - `intent agents uninstall` - Remove Intent-managed agents
  - `intent agents show` - Display agent details and metadata
  - `intent agents status` - Check agent health and integrity

### 📋 JSON Configuration

Configuration has moved from YAML to JSON format with proper local/global hierarchy:
- Local: `.intent/config.json`
- Global: `~/.config/intent/config.json` (follows XDG standard)

### ✅ Full Backwards Compatibility

- `stp` command symlinked to `intent`
- Automatic migration via `intent upgrade`
- All existing projects continue to work

## Installation & Migration

### New Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/matthewsinclair/intent.git
cd intent

# Add to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/bin"

# Bootstrap global configuration
intent bootstrap

# Verify installation
intent doctor
```

### Migration from STP v1.x

```bash
# From your existing STP project
intent upgrade

# The upgrade will:
# 1. Detect your current version
# 2. Create backups
# 3. Migrate directory structure
# 4. Update configuration format
# 5. Preserve all content
```

## Breaking Changes

While we maintain backwards compatibility, these changes affect the underlying structure:

1. **Directory paths have changed**:
   - `stp/prj/st/` → `intent/st/`
   - `stp/prj/wip.md` → `intent/wip.md`
   - Configuration in `.intent/` not `.stp/`

2. **Configuration format**:
   - YAML → JSON
   - New global config location

3. **Repository location**:
   - GitHub: `matthewsinclair/stp` → `matthewsinclair/intent`

## New Features

### Claude Code Agent Integration

- **Pre-built Agents**: Intent and Elixir agents ready to use
- **Agent Management**: Full lifecycle commands (install, sync, uninstall)
- **Project & Global Agents**: Support for both scopes
- **Integrity Checking**: Checksums track modifications
- **Seamless Claude Integration**: Agents automatically enhance Claude sessions

**Quick Start with Agents:**
```bash
# Install the Intent agent
intent agents install intent

# Check agent status
intent agents status

# Now Claude understands Intent methodology!
```

### Enhanced User Experience

- **Better error messages**: Clear, actionable feedback
- **Improved help system**: Context-aware help
- **Streamlined commands**: Consistent interface
- **Progress indicators**: Visual feedback during operations

### Developer Experience

- **Comprehensive test suite**: Full coverage with BATS
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Automated testing
- **Example projects**: Migration demonstrations
- **Enhanced documentation**: Updated for Intent

### Technical Improvements

- **Robust migration**: Fail-forward approach
- **Better path handling**: Works in more environments
- **Dependency management**: Clear requirements (jq, backlog.md)
- **Configuration validation**: Catches errors early
- **Agent manifest tracking**: JSON-based with checksums
- **50 new tests**: Complete agent system test coverage

## Fixed Issues

- GitHub Actions workflows now properly exclude library tests
- Symlink handling improved for cross-platform compatibility
- Test suite reliability enhanced
- Configuration loading hierarchy properly implemented
- Path resolution works correctly in all scenarios

## Known Issues

None at this time. All tests passing on Ubuntu and macOS.

## Upgrading

### From v1.2.1 to v2.0.0

1. **Backup your project** (automatic, but always good practice)
2. Run `intent upgrade` from your project root
3. Review the migration summary
4. Update any custom scripts to use `intent` instead of `stp`
5. Update your PATH if you had hardcoded the old location

### Command Equivalents

All commands remain the same, just replace `stp` with `intent`:

| Old Command | New Command |
|-------------|-------------|
| `stp st new` | `intent st new` |
| `stp bl list` | `intent bl list` |
| `stp task create` | `intent task create` |
| `stp help` | `intent help` |

## Future Roadmap

With the rebrand complete and Claude Code integration shipped, Intent is positioned for:

- **Q3 2025**: Extended agent ecosystem (language-specific agents)
- **Q4 2025**: Team collaboration features
- **2026**: Enterprise scalability and custom agent marketplaces

## Support

- **Documentation**: Updated user and reference guides
- **Issues**: Report bugs at https://github.com/matthewsinclair/intent/issues
- **Help**: Run `intent help` or `intent doctor`
