# Intent v2.2.0 Release Notes

## Overview

Intent v2.2.0 introduces the `fileindex` command, a powerful file indexing and tracking system that enables systematic progress tracking through large codebases. This release also enhances the Elixir agent with systematic code review capabilities.

## New Features

### 1. Fileindex Command

The `intent fileindex` command provides a persistent checkbox-based file tracking system:

- **File Discovery**: Automatically find and index files based on patterns
- **Progress Tracking**: Mark files as checked/unchecked with persistent state
- **Flexible Integration**: Works both within Intent projects and standalone
- **Toggle Functionality**: Quick marking/unmarking of files with `-X` flag

#### Key Commands:
```bash
# Index all Elixir files
intent fileindex '**/*.ex'

# Show current status
intent fileindex --status

# Toggle a file's checked state
intent fileindex -X lib/my_app/user.ex

# Use with custom cache location
intent fileindex --cache-dir /tmp/review '**/*.ex'
```

### 2. Enhanced Elixir Agent

The Elixir agent now supports systematic code review workflows using the fileindex command:

- **Module-based Reviews**: Review entire Elixir modules systematically
- **Path Flexibility**: Accept both module names (e.g., `MyApp.Users`) and filesystem paths
- **Progress Tracking**: Automatically track which files have been reviewed
- **Smart Path Mapping**: Intelligent conversion between Elixir module names and file paths

#### Example Usage:
```
Review the MyApp.Users module systematically, checking each file as you complete it
```

## Improvements

## Credits

This release includes contributions from the Intent community. Special thanks to all testers and users who provided feedback on the fileindex functionality.

## Next Steps

After upgrading to v2.2.0:

1. Run `intent help fileindex` to learn about the new command
2. Try `intent fileindex --demo` to see it in action
3. Use `intent agents list` to see the updated Elixir agent capabilities
4. Run `intent doctor` to verify your installation
