# Intent v2.2.1 Release Notes

## Overview

Intent v2.2.1 is a maintenance release that significantly improves tool dependency management and error handling. This release addresses silent failures when required tools are missing and provides comprehensive guidance for users to resolve dependency issues.

## Key Improvements

### üîß Centralized Version Management

- **Single Source of Truth**: Version is now managed through a `VERSION` file at the project root
- **Consistent Updates**: All scripts dynamically read from the VERSION file, eliminating version inconsistencies
- **Easier Maintenance**: Future version bumps only require updating one file

### üõ†Ô∏è Comprehensive Tool Dependency Checking

The `intent doctor` command now provides detailed dependency analysis:

- **Categorized Tools**: Dependencies are organized into required, core, and optional categories
- **Platform-Specific Instructions**: Installation commands tailored for macOS, Linux distributions, and other systems
- **Clear Severity Levels**: Distinguish between critical errors, warnings, and informational messages

### üö´ No More Silent Failures

- **jq Dependency Handling**: All commands that require jq now fail gracefully with clear error messages
- **Agent Operations**: Fixed silent failures during agent installation, sync, and management when jq is missing
- **Actionable Error Messages**: Every error now includes specific steps to resolve the issue

## What's New

### Added
- `VERSION` file for centralized version management
- `get_intent_version()` function in intent_helpers
- Comprehensive tool dependency checking in `intent doctor`
- Platform-specific installation instructions for all tools
- Better error handling for missing dependencies

### Changed
- Tool dependencies categorized as required, core, and optional
- Enhanced error messages with installation instructions
- All scripts now use centralized version management

### Fixed

- Version number inconsistencies across scripts

## Installation & Upgrade
