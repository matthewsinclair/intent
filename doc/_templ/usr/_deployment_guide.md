## Installation

### System Requirements

- POSIX-compatible shell environment (bash, zsh)
- Git (optional, for version control)
- Text editor with markdown support

### Installation Methods

#### Global Installation

Install STP globally to make it available for all projects:

```bash
# Clone the STP repository
git clone https://github.com/username/stp.git ~/stp

# Add STP bin directory to PATH in shell profile
echo 'export STP_HOME=~/stp' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$STP_HOME/bin' >> ~/.bashrc

# Reload shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Project-Specific Installation

Install STP within a specific project:

```bash
# From your project directory
git clone https://github.com/username/stp.git .stp

# Create a local alias for the project
alias stp='./.stp/bin/stp'
```

#### Installation Verification

Verify the installation:

```bash
stp help
```

This should display the help information for STP commands.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Configure STP behavior using these environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| STP_HOME | Location of STP installation | Path to cloned repository |
| STP_PROJECT | Current project name | Determined from initialization |
| STP_AUTHOR | Default author name | Determined from git configuration |
| STP_EDITOR | Preferred text editor | Determined from system defaults |

Example configuration in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
export STP_HOME=~/stp
export STP_AUTHOR="Jane Doe"
export STP_EDITOR="vim"
```

### Project Configuration

Create a project-specific configuration using `.stp-config`:

```ini
# STP Project Configuration
PROJECT_NAME="Project Name"
AUTHOR="Default Author"
ST_PREFIX="ST"
```

## Integration

### Version Control Integration

STP works seamlessly with git and other version control systems:

#### Recommended .gitignore

```
# STP temporary files
.stp-tmp/
```

#### Commit Practices

- Commit steel thread documents along with code changes
- Use steel thread IDs in commit messages for traceability

#### Branch Strategy

- Create feature branches based on steel threads
- Name branches using steel thread IDs (e.g., `feature/ST0001`)

### CI/CD Integration

## Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

- Update STP installation periodically
- Review and clean up completed steel threads
- Archive older project documents

### Backup Practices

- Include STP documents in regular backups
- Ensure documentation is committed to version control

## Upgrading

### Upgrading STP Installation

To upgrade a global STP installation:

```bash
cd $STP_HOME
git pull
```

To upgrade a project-specific installation:

```bash
cd my-project/.stp
git pull
```

# Context for LLM

This document template is for creating a deployment guide for the STP system. When implementing this guide:

1. Replace placeholder sections with detailed deployment instructions
2. Include system requirements and prerequisites
3. Provide clear, step-by-step installation instructions
4. Detail configuration options and environment variables
5. Include integration strategies for various tools and platforms
6. Add troubleshooting information for common deployment issues

The final deployment guide should provide all necessary information for deploying and configuring the STP system in various environments.
