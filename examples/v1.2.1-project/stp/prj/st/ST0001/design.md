# ST0001: Design Document

## Overview

This steel thread introduces the directory-based structure for organizing steel thread content.

## Design Decisions

1. Each steel thread gets its own directory
2. Standard files include: info.md, design.md, impl.md, tasks.md, results.md
3. Allows for additional files as needed

## Benefits

- Better organization
- Easier to find related content
- Supports more complex steel threads
- Enables file-specific version tracking
