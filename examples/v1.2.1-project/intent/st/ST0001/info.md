# ST0001: Directory-Based Structure

- **Status**: Completed
- **Created**: 2025-01-15
- **Completed**: 2025-01-20
- **Author**: Directory User

## Objective

Demonstrate the v1.2.1 directory-based steel thread structure.

## Context

Starting with v1.2.1, steel threads are organized as directories rather than single files. This allows for better organization of related content.

## Related Steel Threads

None - this is the first steel thread.

## Context for LLM

This example shows the new directory structure where each steel thread has its own folder containing:
- info.md (this file)
- design.md
- impl.md
- tasks.md
