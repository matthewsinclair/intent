# The Steel Thread Methodology: Development with Purpose

## Outline

* **What is a Steel Thread?**
  * Definition and origin of the term
  * A self-contained unit of functionality that delivers value
  * The core organizing principle of STP
  * Steel threads vs. stories vs. epics vs. tickets
  * Why "steel" and not "golden" or something else?

* **How Steel Threads Differ from Traditional Approaches**
  * Contrast with waterfall development
  * Differences from pure agile/scrum methodologies
  * Not just feature branches - intent + implementation together
  * Focus on incremental value rather than arbitrary time boxes
  * Documentation integrated with implementation

* **Anatomy of a Steel Thread**
  * Structure and components of a steel thread document
  * Status tracking and lifecycle
  * Clear objectives and success criteria
  * Implementation plan and tracking
  * How the documentation evolves with the code

* **Managing Work with Steel Threads**
  * Creating and planning steel threads
  * Tracking progress
  * Completing and archiving steel threads
  * Dependencies between steel threads
  * Team collaboration around steel threads

* **Real-world Examples**
  * Example 1: A feature implementation steel thread
  * Example 2: A bug fix steel thread
  * Example 3: A documentation/process steel thread
  * Patterns and anti-patterns in steel thread usage

* **Benefits of the Steel Thread Approach**
  * Better focus on delivering value
  * Improved visibility into project status
  * Documentation that evolves naturally with implementation
  * Enhanced collaboration between team members
  * Clearer demarcation of what's done and what's not
