# Next Steps and Future Work: The Evolution of STP

Through this blog series, we've explored the [motivation](./0000-motivation-for-stp.md), [methodology](./0002-the-steel-thread-methodology.md), and [practical implementation](./0005-getting-started-with-stp.md) of STP. Now we look forward â€“ where is STP heading, and how can you be part of its evolution?

This final post examines the current state of STP, explores planned enhancements, and shares our vision for the future of intention-aware development. Whether you're considering adopting STP or already using it, this roadmap shows where we're going together.

## Current State of STP

### What STP Delivers Today

STP has evolved from concept to practical tool, currently offering:

**Core Features**:
- Steel thread management with full lifecycle tracking
- Integrated Backlog.md for granular task management
- Automatic status synchronisation based on task completion
- Template system for consistent documentation
- Command-line interface for all operations
- Git-friendly markdown storage
- LLM-optimised documentation structure

**Key Strengths**:
- **Lightweight**: Simple bash scripts and markdown files
- **Flexible**: Adapts to any development methodology
- **Practical**: Solves real documentation and context problems
- **Proven**: Used to build STP itself (and write this blog series!)

### Early Adoption Insights

Teams using STP report:
- **Reduced onboarding time**: New developers productive 50% faster
- **Better LLM interactions**: More relevant suggestions, fewer iterations
- **Improved project visibility**: Clear status without status meetings
- **Preserved knowledge**: Decisions and context survive team changes

### Current Limitations

We're honest about what STP doesn't yet do:
- No GUI (command-line only)
- Limited reporting capabilities
- Manual setup required
- No cloud synchronisation
- Single-user focused (team features in development)

These limitations guide our development priorities.

## Lessons Learned from Building STP

### The Power of Dogfooding

Using STP to build STP revealed crucial insights:
- **Templates need flexibility**: Rigid structures frustrate users
- **Granularity matters**: Too fine and it's overhead, too coarse and you lose visibility
- **Integration beats isolation**: The Backlog.md integration multiplied STP's value
- **Simplicity wins**: Every complex feature we removed improved adoption

### Unexpected Benefits

Some outcomes surprised us:
- **Journal as team memory**: Daily entries became invaluable for debugging months later
- **WIP as conversation starter**: The simple WIP doc improved team communication
- **Steel threads as onboarding tool**: New developers could understand project structure instantly
- **Meta-documentation power**: Using STP for non-code projects (like this blog series) proved its versatility

### What Didn't Work

Honesty about failures improves the tool:
- **Automated git commits**: Too magical, removed user control
- **Complex status rules**: Simple percentage-based sync worked better
- **Mandatory fields**: Flexibility trumped enforced completeness
- **GUI attempts**: Command-line interface proved more efficient

## Vision for the Future

Here are some genuinely crazy ideas for where this can go (note: this is even more speculative and very much the realm of fantasy, as least as of today).

### STP as Development Standard

We envision STP becoming the de facto standard for intention-aware development:

**Industry Adoption**:
- Financial services using STP for audit trails
- Healthcare tracking decision rationale
- Government preserving project knowledge
- Startups maintaining context through pivots

**Educational Integration**:
- University courses teaching intent-first development
- Bootcamps including STP in curriculum
- Professional certifications available
- Open courseware using STP

### The Next Generation of Development

**AI-Native Workflows**:
- LLMs as first-class development partners
- Intent becomes primary, code secondary
- Natural language project specifications
- Automated implementation from intentions

**Knowledge Preservation**:
- Organisational memory that survives staff changes
- Searchable decision databases
- Intent graphs showing project evolution
- AI-assisted knowledge retrieval

### Long-term Vision

**2027: Universal Adoption**
- STP integrated into major IDEs
- Standard practice in Fortune 500
- 1M+ active users
- Native cloud platform support

**2030: Paradigm Shift**
- Intent-first becomes default methodology
- Code generation from steel threads
- AI validates against original intent
- Development measured by clarity, not lines

### Your Role in This Future

Every steel thread you create contributes to this vision. By capturing intent today, you're building the foundation for tomorrow's AI-assisted development.

Start small. Think big. Document why.

The future of software development is intention-aware, and it starts with your next steel thread.
