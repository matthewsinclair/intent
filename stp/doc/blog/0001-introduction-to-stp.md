# Introduction to STP: A Better Way to Build Software

## Outline

* **The Problem with Modern Software Development**
  * Increasing complexity of codebases
  * Challenges in communication between teams and team members
  * Knowledge silos and documentation that quickly becomes outdated
  * Difficulty in onboarding new team members
  * Misalignment between initial intent and final implementation

* **What is STP?**
  * Steel Thread Project - definition and core concepts
  * A lightweight methodology for structuring both development and documentation
  * Built around the concept of "steel threads" of functionality
  * Designed to work alongside existing development practices
  * Shell scripts + markdown templates = minimal overhead

* **Core Principles of STP**
  * Documentation as a first-class citizen
  * Intent capture throughout the development lifecycle
  * Incremental development through steel threads
  * Lightweight and adaptable to different workflows
  * Integration with modern LLM tooling

* **The Steel Thread Concept**
  * What is a steel thread? (Preview of the next post)
  * How it differs from traditional work organization
  * Why thinking in terms of steel threads improves development

* **Benefits of STP**
  * Better alignment between intent and implementation
  * Documentation that stays up-to-date
  * Improved onboarding experience
  * Enhanced collaboration with LLMs
  * More efficient development process

* **What's Coming in this Blog Series**
  * Preview of the upcoming posts
  * How each aspect of STP addresses common development challenges
