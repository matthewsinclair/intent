# The Motivation for STP: Why Intention Matters in LLM-Assisted Development

## Outline

* **The Fundamental Challenge of LLM Collaboration**
  * The black box problem: LLMs don't inherently understand your intentions
  * The illusion of understanding versus actual alignment
  * Why standard prompting often leads to misalignment
  * The gap between what you want and what you get
  * The increasing cost of miscommunication as projects grow

* **The Problem of Lost Intention**
  * Why clarifying "what problem are we solving?" is critical
  * Software solutions disconnected from original problems
  * The business cost of intention-implementation misalignment
  * How intention gets diluted through implementation phases
  * The difficulty of evaluating solutions without clear intention

* **Enhancing Traditional Approaches for LLM Collaboration**
  * The intention-capture gap in existing methodologies
  * How STP complements (not replaces) agile, lean, and XP approaches
  * Documentation as a framework for understanding, not an afterthought
  * Adding intention-clarity to your existing process
  * Why intention capture reduces technical debt regardless of methodology
  * Integrating with (not replacing) your current workflow

* **The Missing Layer: Intent Architecture**
  * Intention as the foundation of all technical decisions
  * How clear intention creates clearer constraints
  * The relationship between intention clarity and implementation quality
  * Intention as a filter for evaluating LLM suggestions
  * Building a shared mental model between humans and LLMs

* **Intention-First Development as a Paradigm Shift**
  * Moving from "what to build" to "why we're building it"
  * How intention-first changes the developer-LLM conversation
  * The return on investment in intention clarification
  * Examples of intention transforming implementation approaches
  * Intention as the cornerstone of technical intuition

* **STP: An Answer to the Intention Question**
  * How STP was designed specifically to address the intention challenge
  * The steel thread as an intention container
  * Documentation structure that prioritizes the "why" before the "what"
  * A preview of how STP creates intention alignment throughout development
  * The difference between tool-first and intention-first methodologies
