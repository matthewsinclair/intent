# LLM Collaboration with STP: Multiplying Development Capabilities

## Outline

* **Intention-First LLM Collaboration**
  * Connecting back to the motivation for STP (post 0000)
  * How established intention foundations transform LLM interactions
  * Moving from generic prompting to intention-aligned prompting
  * The multiplier effect of clear intentions on LLM productivity

* **The LLM Collaboration Challenge**
  * Current limitations in LLM-assisted development
  * Context window constraints and information overload
  * The "stale context" problem
  * Difficulty in communicating project structure
  * Challenges in maintaining continuity across sessions

* **How STP Is Designed for LLM Collaboration**
  * The preamble to Claude in the TPD document
  * Structured documentation that fits LLM thinking patterns
  * Just-in-time context loading via steel threads
  * Task-level context with Backlog integration
  * Markdown as a universal interface format
  * The "WIP → Steel Thread → Tasks → Journal" information flow

* **Context Management Strategies**
  * Using the WIP document to orient LLMs
  * Steel threads as focused context containers
  * Task lists with `stp task list ST####` for current work
  * Technical Product Design as the system overview
  * The journal for historical context
  * Template system for consistent document structure
  * Task status as progress indicators for LLMs

* **Templates and Structure that Enhance LLM Effectiveness**
  * The rationale behind STP's template design
  * How structured documentation guides LLM understanding
  * Frontmatter metadata and why it matters
  * Section organization that works with LLM reasoning
  * Consistent formatting that reduces cognitive load

* **The Documentation-Implementation Feedback Loop**
  * Documentation drives implementation
  * Implementation updates documentation
  * LLMs participate in both sides of the cycle
  * The virtuous cycle of clearer intent → better code → improved documentation
  * Real examples of the feedback loop in action

* **Future Opportunities for LLM Integration**
  * Automated documentation generation and validation
  * LLM-powered steel thread creation and management
  * Intelligent context selection based on work in progress
  * Code generation guided by steel thread documentation
  * The potential of Anthropic's Machine Control Protocol (MCP)
