# Intent Capture in Software Development: Bridging the Gap

## Outline

* **Applying Intention Principles in Practice**
  * Taking the motivation (from post 0000) into practical implementation
  * Expanding from "why intention matters" to "how to capture it effectively"
  * Concrete techniques for intention preservation in day-to-day development
  * Moving from theoretical understanding to practical methodologies

* **The Intent Problem in Software Development**
  * What is "intent" in software development?
  * Why intent gets lost during implementation
  * The cost of lost intent: maintenance, onboarding, evolution
  * Common failure modes in communicating intent
  * How traditional documentation falls short

* **Why Intent Matters**
  * Decision-making without understanding the original intent
  * The game of "telephone" in long-lived codebases
  * Intent as context for future changes
  * The difference between what and why
  * Intent preservation as a competitive advantage

* **How STP Addresses the Intent Problem**
  * Documentation alongside code, not separate from it
  * Steel threads as intent containers
  * Versioning documentation with implementation
  * Structured templates that prompt for intent capture
  * The journal, WIP, and TPD documents as living intent records

* **Intent Capture Best Practices**
  * Document decisions, not just outcomes
  * Capture alternatives considered
  * Link intent to requirements and constraints
  * Update intent documentation as understanding evolves
  * Use structured formats that are easy to maintain

* **Intent Capture and LLMs**
  * Why intent documentation is crucial for effective LLM collaboration
  * How LLMs struggle without clear intent
  * Using LLMs to help capture and refine intent
  * LLMs as documentation co-pilots
  * The future of intent-aware AI assistance

* **Case Study: Before and After Intent Capture**
  * Example: A feature without documented intent
  * The same feature with STP-style intent capture
  * The difference in maintenance and evolution
  * Team experiences with explicit intent capture
  * Measuring the ROI of intent documentation
