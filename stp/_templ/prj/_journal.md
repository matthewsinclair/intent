## Context for LLM

This journal provides a historical record of the project's development. Unlike the WIP document which captures the current state, this journal documents the evolution of the project over time.

### How to use this document

1. Add new entries at the top of the document with the current date
2. Include meaningful titles for activities
3. Describe activities, decisions, challenges, and resolutions
4. When completing steel threads, document key outcomes here
5. Note any significant project direction changes or decisions

This document helps both humans and LLMs understand the narrative arc of the project and the reasoning behind past decisions.
