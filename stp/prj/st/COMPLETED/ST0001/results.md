# Results - ST0001: Directory Structure

## Results

The directory structure for the STP system was successfully implemented with all planned components:

- Created the main directory hierarchy for documentation, templates, and scripts
- Established clear separation between template files and active project files
- Created placeholder files to maintain directory structure
- Implemented a logical organization that supports the STP workflow
- Added appropriate naming conventions for consistency

The directory structure provides a solid foundation for the STP system, enabling all other steel threads to build upon this organizational framework. The structure is intuitive for users and supports the various document types and workflows necessary for the system.
