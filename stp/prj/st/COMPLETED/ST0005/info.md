## Objective

Implement the initialization command (`stp init`) that sets up a new STP project structure with all necessary directories and template files.

## Context

The initialization command is a critical component of the STP system, allowing users to quickly bootstrap a new project with the correct directory structure and template files. This steel thread implements the `stp init` command and its supporting functionality.

## Context for LLM

This document represents a single steel thread - a self-contained unit of work focused on implementing a specific piece of functionality. When working with an LLM on this steel thread, start by sharing this document to provide context about what needs to be done.

### How to update this document

1. Update the status as work progresses
2. Check off tasks as they are completed
3. Add implementation notes as decisions are made or challenges encountered
4. Add results when the steel thread is completed
5. Mark the completion date when finished

The LLM should assist with implementation details and help maintain this document as work progresses.
