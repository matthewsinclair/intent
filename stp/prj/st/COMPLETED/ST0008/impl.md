# Implementation - ST0008: LLM Integration

## Implementation Notes

### LLM Integration Points

The STP system integrates LLMs at several key points:

1. **Document Generation**: Templates include LLM-specific context sections that help guide the model in generating appropriate content
2. **Steel Thread Management**: LLMs can assist in planning and documenting steel threads
3. **Technical Design**: LLMs can help with creating and refining technical product design documents
4. **Code Generation**: LLMs can assist with implementation tasks based on steel thread documentation

### LLM Preamble System

The system uses a standardized preamble approach:

1. A base LLM preamble file (`llm_preamble.md`) provides project context
2. Document-specific context sections explain the purpose and structure of each document type
3. Task-specific prompts guide the LLM for particular activities

### LLM-Aware Document Structure

Documents are structured to be LLM-friendly:

1. Clear section headings and hierarchical organization
2. Explicit placeholders and instructions
3. Context sections that are hidden from final rendered output
4. Semantic organization that helps the LLM understand document relationships

### Prompt Engineering Guidance

The implementation includes:

1. Example prompts for common tasks
2. Guidance on prompt construction
3. Strategies for effective LLM collaboration
4. Troubleshooting techniques for common LLM challenges
