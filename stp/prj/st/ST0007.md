# ST0007: User Documentation

- **Status**: Completed
- **Created**: 2025-03-06
- **Completed**: 2025-06-03
- **Author**: Matthew Sinclair

## Objective

Create comprehensive user documentation for the STP system, including a user guide, reference guide, and deployment guide.

## Context

Good documentation is critical for tool adoption and effective use. This steel thread focuses on creating user-focused documentation that explains how to use STP, its features, and how to customize it for different project needs.

## Approach

1. Identify key documentation needs for different user types
2. Create templates for all documentation types
3. Write comprehensive documentation for all STP features
4. Include examples, use cases, and best practices
5. Organize documentation in a logical, accessible manner

## Tasks

- [x] Create a documentation template structure
- [x] Write the user guide covering basic usage
- [x] Write the reference guide documenting all commands and options
- [x] Write the deployment guide for system administrators
- [x] Add usage examples for common scenarios
- [x] Include troubleshooting information
- [x] Document customization options
- [x] Test documentation clarity with sample users
- [x] Implement feedback from documentation testing

## Implementation Notes

### Documentation Structure

The user documentation is divided into three main documents:

1. **User Guide**: Focuses on getting started and common tasks
   - Introduction to STP
   - Installation and setup
   - Basic workflows
   - Best practices
   - Getting help

2. **Reference Guide**: Provides detailed information on all commands
   - Complete command reference
   - Configuration options
   - File formats
   - Template customization
   - Advanced usage

3. **Deployment Guide**: For system administrators and team leads
   - System requirements
   - Installation options
   - Team configuration
   - Integration with other tools
   - Maintenance tasks

### Documentation Design Principles

The documentation follows these principles:

1. **Task-oriented**: Organized around user tasks rather than system features
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Basic information first, with links to more advanced topics
3. **Consistent structure**: Each section follows a consistent format
4. **Examples-rich**: Every feature includes practical examples
5. **Visual aids**: Diagrams and screenshots where helpful

### Cross-References

The documentation maintains consistent cross-references:

- Between documents (e.g., from user guide to reference guide)
- To specific command help documentation
- To steel thread documents for technical details
- To external resources where appropriate

## Results

The user documentation was successfully created with all planned components. The documentation:

- Provides clear guidance for new users to get started
- Offers detailed reference information for advanced users
- Includes examples and best practices for common scenarios
- Is organized logically for easy navigation
- Balances brevity with completeness
- Accommodates different learning styles and needs

The implementation helps users adopt and effectively use the STP system, reducing the learning curve and improving productivity.

## Context for LLM

This document represents a single steel thread - a self-contained unit of work focused on implementing a specific piece of functionality. When working with an LLM on this steel thread, start by sharing this document to provide context about what needs to be done.

### How to update this document

1. Update the status as work progresses
2. Check off tasks as they are completed
3. Add implementation notes as decisions are made or challenges encountered
4. Add results when the steel thread is completed
5. Mark the completion date when finished

The LLM should assist with implementation details and help maintain this document as work progresses.
