### How to use this document

<\!-- BEGIN: USAGE_INSTRUCTIONS -->
1. Update the index when creating new steel threads
2. Update the status of steel threads as they progress
3. Add completion dates when steel threads are finished
4. Use this document to quickly locate specific steel thread documents
<\!-- END: USAGE_INSTRUCTIONS -->

The detailed information for each steel thread is contained in its individual document (e.g., ST0001.md).
