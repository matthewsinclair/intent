## Context for LLM

This document provides an overview of all steel threads in the STP project. It helps track the progress of individual pieces of work and serves as a navigation aid for finding specific steel thread documents.

### How to use this document

1. Update the index when creating new steel threads
2. Update the status of steel threads as they progress
3. Add completion dates when steel threads are finished
4. Use this document to quickly locate specific steel thread documents

The detailed information for each steel thread is contained in its individual document (e.g., ST0001.md).
