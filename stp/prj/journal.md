# Project Journal

This document maintains a chronological record of project activities, decisions, and progress. It serves as a historical narrative of the Steel Thread Project's development.

### Backlog.md Integration

Successfully integrated Backlog.md with STP to provide fine-grained task management capabilities. This integration allows developers to track detailed tasks linked to steel threads, providing better visibility into work progress and enabling automatic status synchronization.

Key accomplishments:
- Created `stp bl` wrapper to provide a streamlined interface to Backlog.md while avoiding git fetch errors
- Implemented `stp task` command for creating and listing tasks linked to specific steel threads
- Implemented `stp status` command to synchronize steel thread status based on task completion metrics
- Implemented `stp migrate` command to help users migrate existing embedded checkbox tasks to Backlog
- Created comprehensive test suites for all new commands
- Updated all documentation (user guide, reference guide, deployment guide, TPD) to reflect the integration

The integration follows STP naming conventions with tasks automatically named in the format "ST#### - Description" for clear traceability. The `stp bl` wrapper configures Backlog for local use, disabling remote operations that can cause errors.

This enhancement provides:
- Granular task tracking that complements high-level steel threads
- Automatic status updates based on task completion
- Seamless migration path from embedded tasks
- Error-free operation through the wrapper interface

### Documentation Update

Updated all project documentation to reflect the current state:
- Updated steel_threads.md to show all completed steel threads and ST0010 (MCP Integration) as on hold
- Updated wip.md with a new "Completed Steel Threads" section to provide better visibility 
- Revised "Next Steps" section to focus on potential future enhancements

### Test Suite Implementation (ST0011)

Completed the comprehensive test suite for STP using the Bats (Bash Automated Testing System) framework. Created tests for:

- Bootstrap script: Verifies directory structure and file creation
- Init command: Tests project initialization with various parameters
- Steel thread commands: Tests creation, listing, displaying, and completion of steel threads
- Help command: Tests help system functionality
- Main script: Tests core command dispatcher

The test architecture includes:

- Isolated test environments using temporary directories
- Custom assertions for file system operations
- Mock functions for simulating various environments
- Test helper library for common functions
- Scripts for running tests and setting up the test environment

This implementation establishes a foundation for ensuring ongoing reliability of STP as new features are added. Only remaining task is setting up continuous integration for automated testing.

### New Steel Thread Creation

Created two new steel threads based on emergent needs:

- ST0010: Anthropic MCP Integration - For exploring the use of Anthropic's Machine Control Protocol in STP scripts. This work is currently on hold and can be addressed later.
- ST0011: Test Suite Implementation - For building the automated test framework. This steel thread has been completed.

### Directory Naming Update

Completed the migration from the old "doc" directory reference to the new "stp" directory name in all scripts and documentation files. This ensures consistency throughout the codebase.

### Project Initialization

The Steel Thread Project (STP) was initiated today. The goal is to create a structured workflow and documentation process for developers working collaboratively with Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Specification Review

Reviewed the initial specification for STP. The system will consist of three main components:

1. Templates: Markdown-based document templates in a structured directory layout
2. Scripts: Shell scripts for managing STP workflows
3. Process: Guidelines and instructions for the steel thread methodology

### Directory Structure Design

Created the initial directory structure for STP. Decided to use "eng" instead of "des" for engineering documentation to better reflect the content. The structure includes:

- prj/: Project documentation
- eng/: Engineering documentation
- usr/: User documentation
- llm/: LLM-specific content
- bin/: STP scripts
- _templ/: Templates

### Technical Product Design

Started developing the Technical Product Design (TPD) document, breaking it into separate sections for easier consumption by both humans and LLMs. The TPD includes:

- Introduction
- Requirements
- Architecture
- Detailed Design
- Implementation Strategy
- Deployment and Operations
- Technical Challenges and Mitigations
- Appendices

### Core Script Framework

Developed the core script framework for STP, including:

- Main `stp` script for command dispatching
- Help system for displaying command documentation
- Init script for project initialization
- Steel thread management script

### Steel Thread Creation

Created the first two steel threads:

- ST0001: Directory Structure
- ST0002: Core Script Framework

These steel threads will serve as the foundation for the rest of the STP development.

## Context for LLM

This journal provides a historical record of the project's development. Unlike the WIP document which captures the current state, this journal documents the evolution of the project over time.

### How to use this document

1. Add new entries at the top of the document with the current date
2. Include meaningful titles for activities
3. Describe activities, decisions, challenges, and resolutions
4. When completing steel threads, document key outcomes here
5. Note any significant project direction changes or decisions

This document helps both humans and LLMs understand the narrative arc of the project and the reasoning behind past decisions.
