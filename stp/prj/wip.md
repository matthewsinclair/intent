# Work In Progress

## Current Focus

### 20250320

**001-DONE: Integrate Backlog.md with STP**

Successfully integrated Backlog.md for fine-grained task management:

- Created `stp bl` wrapper to avoid git fetch errors 
- Implemented `stp task` command for managing tasks linked to steel threads
- Implemented `stp status` command to sync steel thread status based on task completion
- Implemented `stp migrate` command to migrate embedded tasks from steel threads to Backlog
- Created comprehensive test suites for all new commands
- Updated all documentation to reflect the Backlog integration

This integration provides:
- Fine-grained task tracking linked to steel threads
- Automatic status synchronization based on task completion
- Seamless migration from embedded tasks to Backlog
- Error-free operation with the `stp bl` wrapper

### 20250312

**001-DONE: More work on the STP Blog Post Series**

Updated the blog posts with some clearer thinking on why/what/how

### 20250311

**001-DONE: Create STP Blog Post Series**

Creating a series of blog posts to explain STP, its philosophy, and implementation:

- Created ST0013 to track the blog post series development
- Planned a 5-post series covering:
  1. Introduction to STP
  2. The Steel Thread Methodology
  3. Intent Capture in Software Development
  4. LLM Collaboration with STP
  5. Getting Started with STP
- Blog posts will focus on the unique aspects of STP, particularly intent capture and LLM collaboration
- All posts will be stored in the `/stp/doc/blog` directory

### 20240307

**004-DONE: Updated project documentation**

Updated all project documentation to reflect current status:

- Updated steel_threads.md to show ST0011 as completed and ST0010 as on hold
- Ensured all steel thread documents have the correct status
- Updated wip.md to reflect current state

**003-DONE: Build a test suite**

Implemented and fixed a comprehensive test suite (ST0011) with tests for bootstrap, init, steel thread commands, help command, and the main stp script. Created test helper functions, test architecture, and scripts to run tests and set up the test environment. Fixed multiple issues:

- Modified test runner to exclude library test files
- Added .gitignore for test directory
- Fixed interactive script testing using expect utility
- Improved string pattern matching for special characters
- Enhanced test reliability for all components
Only remaining task is setting up continuous integration, which can be addressed later.

**002-DONE: Consider potential use of Anthropic MCP?**

Created ST0010 to explore the potential use of Anthropic's Machine Control Protocol (MCP) for allowing STP scripts to interact with LLMs in a more controlled manner. This work is now on hold and can be addressed later as needed.

**001-DONE: Updating directory references from "doc" to "stp"**

Completed:

1. Updated all shell scripts (bootstrap, stp, stp_help, stp_init, stp_st) to reflect new directory structure
2. Updated all documentation files with correct directory references
3. Confirmed all relative and absolute paths now use "stp" instead of "doc"

## Notes

- The directory name for engineering documentation has been changed from "des" to "eng" to better reflect its content
- The Technical Product Design (TPD) document has been split into separate files for easier management
- All templates use markdown format for maximum portability
- Scripts follow POSIX compatibility for cross-platform support
- The system is designed to be lightweight with minimal dependencies

## Context for LLM

This document captures the current state of development on the Steel Thread Process. When beginning work with an LLM assistant, start by sharing this document to provide context about what's currently being worked on.

### Next Steps

1. Set up continuous integration for test automation (remaining task from ST0011)
2. Consider implementing configuration settings for customizing STP behavior
3. Explore version control integration features
4. Develop additional canned prompts for common tasks
5. Complete implementation of directory structure for steel threads (ST0014)

### Questions to Address

- Should we add a configuration command to customize STP behavior?
- How can we best handle version control integration?
- What additional canned prompts would be most useful for common tasks?
