# Work In Progress

## Current Focus

**001: Implementing the core foundation of the Steel Thread Project (STP) system**

Focusing on:

1. Directory structure and organization
2. Core script framework
3. Template design and creation

## Active Steel Threads

- ST0001: Directory Structure - Creating the initial directory structure and placeholder files
- ST0002: Core Script Framework - Implementing the main `stp` script and command dispatching

## Upcoming Work

- Create the template system (ST0003)
- Implement steel thread commands (ST0004)
- Finalize the initialization command (ST0005)
- Complete the help system (ST0006)
- Develop user documentation (ST0007)

## Notes

- The directory name for engineering documentation has been changed from "des" to "eng" to better reflect its content
- The Technical Product Design (TPD) document has been split into separate files for easier management
- All templates use markdown format for maximum portability
- Scripts follow POSIX compatibility for cross-platform support
- The system is designed to be lightweight with minimal dependencies

## Context for LLM

This document captures the current state of development on the Steel Thread Project. When beginning work with an LLM assistant, start by sharing this document to provide context about what's currently being worked on.

### Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining tasks for ST0001 and ST0002
2. Begin work on ST0003 (Template System)
3. Update the technical product design with any new insights
4. Create additional help documentation as needed

### Questions to Address

- Should we add a configuration command to customize STP behavior?
- How can we best handle version control integration?
- What additional canned prompts would be most useful for common tasks?
