STP - A steel thread process for helping LLMs help you work with your code

Look in the [Technical Product Design](<./stp/eng/technical_product_design.md>) for info on the overall design of STP.

Day-to-day project manangement can be found in [WIP](<./stp/prj/wip.md>) and active, planned, and completed work can be found in [Steel Threads](<./stp/prj/st/steel_threads.md>). For a historical perspective on what has happened here, check out the [Journal](<./stp/prj/journal.md>).

Scripts to help you work with STP can be found in `stp/bin`.

Try `$ stp help` to get started, or `$ stp st list` to get a list of the steel threads.
