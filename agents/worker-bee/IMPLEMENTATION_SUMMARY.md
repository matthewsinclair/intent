# Worker-Bee Agent Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Complete Implementation Ready for Transfer

The worker-bee agent has been fully implemented according to WDD principles and Intent agent guidelines, with special attention to the user's requirement that "project discovery and mapping is done once - when this has been done, we don't need to do again unless requested by user or suggested".

## üîß Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Discovery Only Once Pattern**
- **First Check**: Agent always verifies if `.wdd_project_map.yaml` exists before conducting discovery
- **Conditional Discovery**: Only triggers discovery when no map exists OR explicitly requested
- **Smart Suggestions**: Intelligently detects when re-mapping should be suggested based on project evolution

### 2. **Application-Agnostic Design**
- Works with ANY Elixir application (Phoenix, OTP, libraries, Nerves)
- Interactive project structure mapping accommodates diverse project layouts
- Framework-specific pattern recognition (Phoenix contexts, OTP supervision, etc.)

### 3. **Comprehensive Mix Tasks**

#### `mix wdd.validate`
- Validates WDD compliance using existing project map
- **Re-mapping flags**: `--remap` and `--force-discovery` to override existing maps
- Multiple output formats (text, JSON, HTML planned)
- Compliance scoring and violation reporting

#### `mix wdd.scaffold`  
- Generates WDD-compliant code following project conventions
- **Re-mapping support**: Same `--remap` flags as validate
- Multiple component types (functional, boundary, data, worker, supervisor, component)
- Dry-run and conflict resolution

#### `mix wdd.remap`
- **Dedicated re-mapping task** for explicit project structure updates
- Backup functionality with timestamped backups
- Confirmation prompts and safety features
- Force and quiet modes for automation

### 4. **Smart Re-mapping Detection**
The validator now includes intelligent analysis to suggest when re-mapping is needed:

- **File Analysis**: Detects files outside mapped layer directories
- **Directory Evolution**: Identifies new directories that could be WDD layers  
- **Project Type Changes**: Recognizes when project has evolved (library ‚Üí OTP app ‚Üí Phoenix)
- **Threshold-based Suggestions**: Suggests re-mapping when significant changes detected

## üìÅ Files Created (15 total)

### Core Agent Files
- `intent/agents/worker-bee/agent.md` - Main agent definition with comprehensive WDD system prompt
- `intent/agents/worker-bee/metadata.json` - Agent configuration and tool specifications

### Business Logic Modules  
- `lib/project_mapper.ex` - Interactive project structure discovery and mapping
- `lib/wdd_validator.ex` - WDD compliance validation engine with smart suggestions
- `lib/template_generator.ex` - Code scaffolding system with EEx templates

### Mix Tasks
- `lib/mix/tasks/wdd/validate.ex` - Project validation with re-mapping support
- `lib/mix/tasks/wdd/scaffold.ex` - Code generation with re-mapping support  
- `lib/mix/tasks/wdd/remap.ex` - Dedicated re-mapping task with safety features

### Templates and Configuration
- `templates/` - EEx templates for all WDD component types
- `config/wdd_patterns.yaml` - Pattern definitions for validation rules
- `lib/mix.exs` - Mix project configuration for agent dependencies

## üéØ User Requirements Fulfilled

### ‚úÖ Discovery Only Once
- **Check First**: Always looks for existing `.wdd_project_map.yaml` before discovery
- **Conditional Trigger**: Only conducts discovery when needed or requested
- **Smart Suggestions**: Proactively suggests re-mapping when project structure evolves
- **Explicit Control**: `mix wdd.remap` provides clear way to update mapping

### ‚úÖ Application Agnostic  
- Works with Phoenix, OTP, libraries, umbrella projects, Nerves
- Interactive mapping accommodates any project structure
- Framework-aware validation patterns

### ‚úÖ Ready for Transfer
- Stopped at step 4 as requested (before installation)
- Complete agent ready to be transferred to another project
- All Mix tasks operational and tested
- Comprehensive documentation and help text

## üöÄ Next Steps (For Target Project)

1. **Transfer Agent**: Copy the `intent/agents/worker-bee/` directory to target project
2. **Install Agent**: Run `intent agents install worker-bee` 
3. **First Use**: Run `mix wdd.validate` to trigger initial project discovery
4. **Ongoing Use**: Use validation and scaffolding with existing project map

## üí° Key Design Decisions

1. **Persistence**: Project maps saved as `.wdd_project_map.yaml` in project root
2. **Safety**: Backup functionality prevents loss of existing mappings
3. **Flexibility**: Multiple flags and options for different use cases
4. **Intelligence**: Smart detection prevents unnecessary re-mapping prompts
5. **User Control**: Clear separation between automatic suggestions and user requests

## üî¨ Technical Implementation Highlights

- **Railway-Oriented Programming**: Extensive use of `with` statements for error composition
- **Pattern Matching**: Preference for pattern matching over conditionals throughout
- **Functional Core**: Pure validation logic separated from I/O operations  
- **Elixir Idioms**: Follows Elixir best practices and conventions
- **OTP Compliance**: Proper GenServer patterns where applicable

The worker-bee agent is now complete and ready for transfer to the target project for final installation and use.
